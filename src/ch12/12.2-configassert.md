## 12.2 configASSERT()

In C, the macro `assert()` is used to verify an *assertion* (an
assumption) made by the program. The assertion is written as a C
expression, and if the expression evaluates to false (0), then the
assertion has deemed to have failed. For example, Listing 12.1 tests the
assertion that the pointer `pxMyPointer` is not NULL.


<a name="list12.1" title="Listing 12.1 Using the standard C assert() macro to check pxMyPointer is not NULL"></a>

```c
/* Test the assertion that pxMyPointer is not NULL */
assert( pxMyPointer != NULL );
```
***Listing 12.1*** *Using the standard C assert() macro to check pxMyPointer is not NULL*

The application writer specifies the action to take if an assertion
fails by providing an implementation of the `assert()` macro.

The FreeRTOS source code does not call `assert()`, because `assert()` is not
available with all the compilers with which FreeRTOS is compiled.
Instead, the FreeRTOS source code contains lots of calls to a macro
called `configASSERT()`, which can be defined by the application writer in
`FreeRTOSConfig.h`, and behaves exactly like the standard C `assert()`.

A failed assertion must be treated as a fatal error. Do not attempt to
execute past a line that has failed an assertion.

Defining `configASSERT()` will greatly assist in run-time debugging, but
will also increase the application code size, and therefore slow down
its execution. If a definition of `configASSERT()` is not provided, then
the default empty definition will be used, and all the calls to
`configASSERT()` will be completely removed by the C pre-processor.


### 12.2.1 Example configASSERT() definitions

The definition of `configASSERT()` shown in Listing 12.2 is useful when an
application is being executed under the control of a debugger. It will
halt execution on any line that fails an assertion, so the line that
failed the assertion will be the line displayed by the debugger when the
debug session is paused.


<a name="list12.2" title="Listing 12.2 A simple configASSERT() definition useful when executing under the control of a debugger"></a>

```c
/* Disable interrupts so the tick interrupt stops executing, then sit
   in a loop so execution does not move past the line that failed the
   assertion. If the hardware supports a debug break instruction, then the
   debug break instruction can be used in place of the for() loop. */

#define configASSERT( x ) if( ( x ) == 0 ) { taskDISABLE_INTERRUPTS(); for(;;); }
```
***Listing 12.2*** *A simple configASSERT() definition useful when executing under the control of a debugger*

The definition of `configASSERT()` shown in Listing 12.3 is useful when an
application is not being executed under the control of a debugger. It
prints out, or otherwise records, the source code line that failed an
assertion. The line that failed the assertion is identified using the
standard C `__FILE__` macro to obtain the name of the source file, and
the standard C `__LINE__` macro to obtain the line number within the
source file.


<a name="list12.3" title="Listing 12.3 A configASSERT() definition that records the source code line that failed an assertion"></a>

```c
/* This function must be defined in a C source file, not the FreeRTOSConfig.h 
   header file. */
void vAssertCalled( const char *pcFile, uint32_t ulLine )
{
    /* Inside this function, pcFile holds the name of the source file that 
       contains the line that detected the error, and ulLine holds the line 
       number in the source file. The pcFile and ulLine values can be printed 
       out, or otherwise recorded, before the following infinite loop is 
       entered. */
    RecordErrorInformationHere( pcFile, ulLine );

    /* Disable interrupts so the tick interrupt stops executing, then sit in a 
       loop so execution does not move past the line that failed the assertion. */
    taskDISABLE_INTERRUPTS();
    for( ;; );
}
/*-----------------------------------------------------------*/

/* These following two lines must be placed in FreeRTOSConfig.h. */
extern void vAssertCalled( const char *pcFile, unsigned long ulLine );
#define configASSERT( x ) if( ( x ) == 0 ) vAssertCalled( __FILE__, __LINE__ )
```
