## 12.6 Trace Hook Macros

Trace macros are macros that have been placed at key points within the
FreeRTOS source code. By default, the macros are empty, and so do not
generate any code, and have no run time overhead. By overriding the
default empty implementations, an application writer can:

- Insert code into FreeRTOS without modifying the FreeRTOS source
  files.

- Output detailed execution sequencing information by any means
  available on the target hardware. Trace macros appear in enough
  places in the FreeRTOS source code to allow them to be used to
  create a full and detailed scheduler activity trace and profiling
  log.


### 12.6.1 Available Trace Hook Macros

It would take too much space to detail every macro here. The list below
details the subset of macros deemed to be most useful to an application
writer.

Many of the descriptions in the list below refer to a variable called
`pxCurrentTCB`. `pxCurrentTCB` is a FreeRTOS private variable that holds the
handle of the task in the Running state, and is available to any macro
that is called from the FreeRTOS/Source/tasks.c source file.

**A selection of the most commonly used trace hook macros**

- `traceTASK_INCREMENT_TICK(xTickCount)`

  Called during the tick interrupt, before the tick count is incremented. The `xTickCount` parameter 
  passes the new tick count value into the macro.

- `traceTASK_SWITCHED_OUT()`

  Called before a new task is selected to run. At this point, `pxCurrentTCB` contains the handle of 
  the task about to leave the Running state.

- `traceTASK_SWITCHED_IN()`

  Called after a task is selected to run. At this point, `pxCurrentTCB` contains the handle of the 
  task about to enter the Running state.

- `traceBLOCKING_ON_QUEUE_RECEIVE(pxQueue)`
  
  Called immediately before the currently executing task enters the Blocked state following an attempt 
  to read from an empty queue, or an attempt to 'take' an empty semaphore or mutex. The `pxQueue` parameter 
  passes the handle of the target queue or semaphore into the macro.

- `traceBLOCKING_ON_QUEUE_SEND(pxQueue)`
  
  Called immediately before the currently executing task enters the Blocked state following an attempt 
  to write to a queue that is full. The `pxQueue` parameter passes the handle of the target queue into 
  the macro.

- `traceQUEUE_SEND(pxQueue)`
  
  Called from within `xQueueSend()`, `xQueueSendToFront()`, `xQueueSendToBack()`, or any of the semaphore 
  'give' functions, when the queue send or semaphore 'give' is successful. The `pxQueue` parameter passes 
  the handle of the target queue or semaphore into the macro.

- `traceQUEUE_SEND_FAILED(pxQueue)`

  Called from within `xQueueSend()`, `xQueueSendToFront()`, `xQueueSendToBack()`, or any of the semaphore 
  'give' functions, when the queue send or semaphore 'give' operation fails. A queue send or semaphore 
  'give' will fail if the queue is full and remains full for the duration of any block time specified. 
  The `pxQueue` parameter passes the handle of the target queue or semaphore into the macro.

- `traceQUEUE_RECEIVE(pxQueue)`

  Called from within `xQueueReceive()` or any of the semaphore 'take' functions when the queue receive or 
  semaphore 'take' is successful. The `pxQueue` parameter passes the handle of the target queue or semaphore 
  into the macro.

- `traceQUEUE_RECEIVE_FAILED(pxQueue)`

  Called from within `xQueueReceive()` or any of the semaphore 'take' functions when the queue or semaphore 
  receive operation fails. A queue receive or semaphore 'take' operation will fail if the queue or semaphore 
  is empty and remains empty for the duration of any block time specified. The `pxQueue` parameter passes the 
  handle of the target queue or semaphore into the macro.

- `traceQUEUE_SEND_FROM_ISR(pxQueue)`

  Called from within `xQueueSendFromISR()` when the send operation is successful. The `pxQueue` parameter 
  passes the handle of the target queue into the macro.

- `traceQUEUE_SEND_FROM_ISR_FAILED(pxQueue)`

  Called from within `xQueueSendFromISR()` when the send operation fails. A send operation will fail 
  if the queue is already full. The `pxQueue` parameter passes the handle of the target queue into the 
  macro.

- `traceQUEUE_RECEIVE_FROM_ISR(pxQueue)`

  Called from within `xQueueReceiveFromISR()` when the receive operation is successful. The `pxQueue` 
  parameter passes the handle of the target queue into the macro.

- `traceQUEUE_RECEIVE_FROM_ISR_FAILED(pxQueue)`

  Called from within `xQueueReceiveFromISR()` when the receive operation fails due to the queue already 
  being empty. The `pxQueue` parameter passes the handle of the target queue into the macro.

- `traceTASK_DELAY_UNTIL( xTimeToWake )`

  Called from within `xTaskDelayUntil()` immediately before the calling task enters the Blocked state.

- `traceTASK_DELAY()`

  Called from within `vTaskDelay()` immediately before the calling task enters the Blocked state.


### 12.6.2 Defining Trace Hook Macros

Each trace macro has a default empty definition. The default definition
can be overridden by providing a new macro definition in
FreeRTOSConfig.h. If trace macro definitions become long or complex,
then they can be implemented in a new header file that is then itself
included from FreeRTOSConfig.h.

In accordance with software engineering best practice, FreeRTOS
maintains a strict data hiding policy. Trace macros allow user code to
be added to the FreeRTOS source files, so the data types visible to the
trace macros will be different to those visible to application code:

- Inside the FreeRTOS/Source/tasks.c source file, a task handle is a
  pointer to the data structure that describes a task (the task's
  *Task Control Block*, or *TCB*). Outside of the
  FreeRTOS/Source/tasks.c source file a task handle is a pointer to
  void.

- Inside the FreeRTOS/Source/queue.c source file, a queue handle is a
  pointer to the data structure that describes a queue. Outside of the
  FreeRTOS/Source/queue.c source file a queue handle is a pointer to
  void.

> *Extreme caution is required if a normally private FreeRTOS data
> structure is accessed directly by a trace macro, as private data
> structures might change between FreeRTOS versions.*
