## 12.3 Tracealyzer for FreeRTOS

Tracealyzer for FreeRTOS is a run-time diagnostic and optimization tool provided
by our partner company, Percepio.

Tracealyzer for FreeRTOS captures valuable dynamic behavior information, then
presents the captured information in interconnected graphical views. The
tool is also capable of displaying multiple synchronized views.

The captured information is invaluable when analyzing, troubleshooting,
or simply optimizing a FreeRTOS application.

Tracealyzer for FreeRTOS can be used side-by-side with a traditional debugger, and
complements the debugger's view with a higher level, time-based
perspective.
