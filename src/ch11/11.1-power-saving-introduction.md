## 11.1 Power Saving Introduction

FreeRTOS offers an easy way to tap into low power modes with the IDLE task 
hooks and tickless Idle mode.

It is common to reduce the power consumed by the microcontroller on which FreeRTOS is running by using 
the IDLE task hook to place the microcontroller into a low power state. The power saving that can be 
achieved by this method is limited by the necessity to periodically exit and then re-enter the low power 
state to process tick interrupts. Further, if the frequency of the tick interrupt is too high (wake from 
idle is too frequent), the energy and time consumed entering and then exiting a low power state for every 
tick will outweigh any potential power saving gains for all but the lightest power saving modes.
 
FreeRTOS supports a low power state that allows the microcontroller to periodically enter and exit low 
power consumption. The FreeRTOS tickless idle mode stops the periodic tick interrupt during idle periods 
(when there are no application tasks that are able to execute), which allows the MCU to remain in a deep 
power saving state until either an interrupt occurs, or it is time for the RTOS kernel to transition a 
task into the Ready state. It then makes a correcting adjustment to the RTOS tick count value when the 
tick interrupt is restarted. The principle of the FreeRTOS tickless mode is to make the MCU enter the 
low-power mode to save system power consumption when the MCU is performing the idle task.
