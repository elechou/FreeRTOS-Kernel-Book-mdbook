## 11.4 Implementing portSUPPRESS\_TICKS\_AND\_SLEEP() Macro

If the FreeRTOS port in use does not provide a default implementation of `portSUPPRESS_TICKS_AND_SLEEP()`, 
then the application writer can provide their own implementation by defining `portSUPPRESS_TICKS_AND_SLEEP()` 
in FreeRTOSConfig.h. If the FreeRTOS port in use does provide a default implementation of `portSUPPRESS_TICKS_AND_SLEEP()`, 
then the application writer can override the default implementation by defining `portSUPPRESS_TICKS_AND_SLEEP()` 
in FreeRTOSConfig.h. 

The following source code is an example of how `portSUPPRESS_TICKS_AND_SLEEP()` might be implemented by an 
application writer. The example is basic, and will introduce some slippage between the time maintained by 
the kernel and calendar time. Of the function calls shown in the example, only `vTaskStepTick()` 
and `eTaskConfirmSleepModeStatus()` are part of the FreeRTOS API. The other functions are specific to the 
clocks and power saving modes available on the hardware in use, and as such, must be provided by the 
application writer.

               other than that configured by the vSetWakeTimeInterrupt() call.
