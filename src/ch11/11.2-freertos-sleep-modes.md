## 11.2 FreeRTOS Sleep Modes

There are three types of sleep modes supported in FreeRTOS: 

1. eAbortSleep - This mode denotes a task has been made ready , a context switch was pended or a tick 
   interrupt has already occurred but was pended since the scheduler was suspended. It signals the RTOS 
   to abort entering a sleep mode.

2. eStandardSleep - This mode allows to enter a sleep mode that will not last longer than the expected 
   idle time.

3. eNoTasksWaitingTimeout - This mode is entered when no tasks are waiting for a timeout so it is safe to 
   enter a sleep mode that can only be exited by an external interrupt or reset.
