## 9.3 Event Management Using Event Groups

### 9.3.1 The xEventGroupCreate() API Function

FreeRTOS also includes the `xEventGroupCreateStatic()` function,
which allocates the memory required to create an event group statically
at compile time: An event group must be explicitly created before it can
be used.

Event groups are referenced using variables of type `EventGroupHandle_t`.
The `xEventGroupCreate()` API function is used to create an event group,
and returns an `EventGroupHandle_t` to reference the event group it
creates.


<a name="list9.1" title="Listing 9.1 The xEventGroupCreate() API function prototype"></a>

```c
EventGroupHandle_t xEventGroupCreate( void );
```
***Listing 9.1*** *The xEventGroupCreate() API function prototype*


**xEventGroupCreate() return value**

- Return Value

  If NULL is returned, then the event group cannot be created
  because there is insufficient heap memory available for FreeRTOS to
  allocate the event group data structures. Chapter 3 provides more
  information on heap memory management.

  A non-NULL value being returned indicates that the event group has
  been created successfully. The returned value should be stored as the
  handle to the created event group.


### 9.3.2 The xEventGroupSetBits() API Function

The `xEventGroupSetBits()` API function sets one or more bits in an event
group, and is typically used to notify a task that the events
represented by the bit, or bits, being set has occurred.

> *Note: Never call `xEventGroupSetBits()` from an interrupt service
> routine. The interrupt-safe version `xEventGroupSetBitsFromISR()` should
> be used in its place.*


<a name="list9.2" title="Listing 9.2. The xEventGroupSetBits() API function prototype"></a>

```c
EventBits_t xEventGroupSetBits( EventGroupHandle_t xEventGroup,

const EventBits_t uxBitsToSet );
```
***Listing 9.2*** *The xEventGroupSetBits() API function prototype*


**xEventGroupSetBits() parameters and return value**

- `xEventGroup`

  The handle of the event group in which bits are being set. The event
  group handle will have been returned from the call to
  `xEventGroupCreate()` used to create the event group.

- `uxBitsToSet`

  A bit mask that specifies the event bit, or event bits, to set to
  1 in the event group. The value of the event group is updated by bitwise
  ORing the event group's existing value with the value passed in
  `uxBitsToSet`.

  As an example, setting `uxBitsToSet` to 0x04 (binary 0100) will result
  in event bit 3 in the event group becoming set (if it was not already
  set), while leaving all the other event bits in the event group
  unchanged.

- Return Value

  The value of the event group at the time the call to
  `xEventGroupSetBits()` returned. Note that the value returned will not
  necessarily have the bits specified by `uxBitsToSet` set, because the bits
  may have been cleared again by a different task.


### 9.3.3 The xEventGroupSetBitsFromISR() API Function

`xEventGroupSetBitsFromISR()` is the interrupt safe version of
`xEventGroupSetBits()`.

Giving a semaphore is a deterministic operation because it is known in
advance that giving a semaphore can result in at most one task leaving
the Blocked state. When bits are set in an event group it is not known
in advance how many tasks will leave the Blocked state, so setting bits
in an event group is not a deterministic operation.

The FreeRTOS design and implementation standard does not permit
non-deterministic operations to be performed inside an interrupt service
routine, or when interrupts are disabled. For that reason,
`xEventGroupSetBitsFromISR()` does not set event bits directly inside the
interrupt service routine, but instead defers the action to the RTOS
daemon task.


<a name="list9.3" title="Listing 9.3 The xEventGroupSetBitsFromISR() API function prototype"></a>

```c
BaseType_t xEventGroupSetBitsFromISR( EventGroupHandle_t xEventGroup,
                                      const EventBits_t uxBitsToSet,
                                      BaseType_t *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken );
```
***Listing 9.3*** *The xEventGroupSetBitsFromISR() API function prototype*


**xEventGroupSetBitsFromISR() parameters and return value**

- `xEventGroup`

  The handle of the event group in which bits are being set. The event
  group handle will have been returned from the call to
  `xEventGroupCreate()` used to create the event group.

- `uxBitsToSet`

  A bit mask that specifies the event bit, or event bits, to set to
  1 in the event group. The value of the event group is updated by bitwise
  ORing the event group's existing value with the value passed in
  `uxBitsToSet`.

  As an example, setting `uxBitsToSet` to 0x05 (binary 0101) will result
  in event bit 2 and event bit 0 in the event group becoming set (if they
  were not already set), while leaving all the other event bits in the
  event group unchanged.

- `pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken`

  `xEventGroupSetBitsFromISR()` does not set the event bits directly
  inside the interrupt service routine, but instead defers the action to
  the RTOS daemon task by sending a command on the timer command queue. If
  the daemon task was in the Blocked state to wait for data to become
  available on the timer command queue, then writing to the timer command
  queue will cause the daemon task to leave the Blocked state. If the
  priority of the daemon task is higher than the priority of the currently
  executing task (the task that was interrupted), then, internally,
  `xEventGroupSetBitsFromISR()` will set `*pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken` to
  `pdTRUE`.

  If `xEventGroupSetBitsFromISR()` sets this value to `pdTRUE`, then a
  context switch should be performed before the interrupt is exited. This
  will ensure that the interrupt returns directly to the daemon task, as
  the daemon task will be the highest priority Ready state task.

- Return Value

  There are two possible return values:

  - `pdPASS` will be returned only if data was successfully sent to the
    timer command queue.

  - `pdFALSE` will be returned if the 'set bits' command could not be
    written to the timer command queue because the queue was already
    full.


### 9.3.4 The xEventGroupWaitBits() API Function

The `xEventGroupWaitBits()` API function allows a task to read the value
of an event group, and optionally wait in the Blocked state for one or
more event bits in the event group to become set, if the event bits are
not already set.


<a name="list9.4" title="Listing 9.4 The xEventGroupWaitBits() API function prototype"></a>

```c
EventBits_t xEventGroupWaitBits( EventGroupHandle_t xEventGroup,
                                 const EventBits_t uxBitsToWaitFor,
                                 const BaseType_t xClearOnExit,
                                 const BaseType_t xWaitForAllBits,
                                 TickType_t xTicksToWait );
```
***Listing 9.4*** *The xEventGroupWaitBits() API function prototype*

The condition used by the scheduler to determine if a task will enter
the Blocked state, and when a task will leave the Blocked state, is
called the 'unblock condition'. The unblock condition is specified by a
combination of the `uxBitsToWaitFor` and the `xWaitForAllBits` parameter
values:

- `uxBitsToWaitFor` specifies which event bits in the event group to
  test

- `xWaitForAllBits` specifies whether to use a bitwise OR test, or a
  bitwise AND test

A task will not enter the Blocked state if its unblock condition is met
at the time `xEventGroupWaitBits()` is called.

Examples of conditions that will result in a task either entering the
Blocked state, or exiting the Blocked state, are provided in Table 6.
Table 6 only shows the least significant four binary bits of the event
group and uxBitsToWaitFor valuesâ€”the other bits of those two values are
assumed to be zero.

<a name="tbl6" title="Table 6 The Effect of the uxBitsToWaitFor and xWaitForAllBits Parameters"></a>

* * *
| Existing Event Group Value | uxBitsToWaitFor value | xWaitForAllBits value | Resultant Behavior |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ |
| 0000 | 0101 | pdFALSE | The calling task will enter the Blocked state because neither of bit 0 or bit 2 are set in the event group, and will leave the Blocked state when either bit 0 OR bit 2 are set in the event group. |
| 0100 | 0101 | pdTRUE | The calling task will enter the Blocked state because bit 0 and bit 2 are not both set in the event group, and will leave the Blocked state when both bit 0 AND bit 2 are set in the event group. |
| 0100 | 0110 | pdFALSE | The calling task will not enter the Blocked state because xWaitForAllBits is pdFALSE, and one of the two bits specified by uxBitsToWaitFor is already set in the event group. |
| 0100 | 0110 | pdTRUE | The calling task will enter the Blocked state because xWaitForAllBits is pdTRUE, and only one of the two bits specified by uxBitsToWaitFor is already set in the event group. The task will leave the Blocked state when both bit 1 and bit 2 are set in the event group. |

***Table 6*** *The Effect of the uxBitsToWaitFor and xWaitForAllBits Parameters*
* * *

The calling task specifies bits to test using the `uxBitsToWaitFor`
parameter, and it is likely the calling task will need to clear these
bits back to zero after its unblock condition has been met. Event bits
can be cleared using the `xEventGroupClearBits()` API function, but using
that function to manually clear event bits will lead to race conditions
in the application code if:

- There is more than one task using the same event group.
- Bits are set in the event group by a different task, or by an
  interrupt service routine.

The `xClearOnExit` parameter is provided to avoid these potential race
conditions. If `xClearOnExit` is set to `pdTRUE`, then the testing and
clearing of event bits appears to the calling task to be an atomic
operation (uninterruptable by other tasks or interrupts).

**xEventGroupWaitBits() parameters and return value**

- `xEventGroup`

  The handle of the event group that contains the event bits being
  read. The event group handle will have been returned from the call to
  `xEventGroupCreate()` used to create the event group.

- `uxBitsToWaitFor`

  A bit mask that specifies the event bit, or event bits, to test
  in the event group.

  For example, if the calling task wants to wait for event bit 0 and/or
  event bit 2 to become set in the event group, then set `uxBitsToWaitFor`
  to 0x05 (binary 0101). Refer to Table 6 for further examples.

- `xClearOnExit`

  If the calling task's unblock condition has been met, and
  `xClearOnExit` is set to `pdTRUE`, then the event bits specified by
  `uxBitsToWaitFor` will be cleared back to 0 in the event group before the
  calling task exits the `xEventGroupWaitBits()` API function.

  If `xClearOnExit` is set to `pdFALSE`, then the state of the event bits
  in the event group are not modified by the `xEventGroupWaitBits()` API
  function.

- `xWaitForAllBits`

  The `uxBitsToWaitFor` parameter specifies the event bits to test in
  the event group. `xWaitForAllBits` specifies if the calling task should be
  removed from the Blocked state when one or more of the events bits
  specified by the `uxBitsToWaitFor` parameter are set, or only when all of
  the event bits specified by the `uxBitsToWaitFor` parameter are set.

  If `xWaitForAllBits` is set to `pdFALSE`, then a task that entered the
  Blocked state to wait for its unblock condition to be met will leave the
  Blocked state when any of the bits specified by `uxBitsToWaitFor` become
  set (or the timeout specified by the `xTicksToWait` parameter expires).

  If `xWaitForAllBits` is set to `pdTRUE`, then a task that entered the
  Blocked state to wait for its unblock condition to be met will only
  leave the Blocked state when all of the bits specified by
  `uxBitsToWaitFor` are set (or the timeout specified by the `xTicksToWait`
  parameter expires).

  Refer to Table 6 for examples.

- `xTicksToWait`

  The maximum amount of time the task should remain in the Blocked
  state to wait for its unblock condition to be met.

  `xEventGroupWaitBits()` will return immediately if `xTicksToWait` is
  zero, or the unblock condition is met at the time `xEventGroupWaitBits()`
  is called.

  The block time is specified in tick periods, so the absolute time it
  represents is dependent on the tick frequency. The macro `pdMS_TO_TICKS()`
  can be used to convert a time specified in milliseconds into a time
  specified in ticks.

  Setting `xTicksToWait` to `portMAX_DELAY` will cause the task to wait
  indefinitely (without timing out), provided `INCLUDE_vTaskSuspend` is set
  to 1 in FreeRTOSConfig.h.

- Returned Value

  If `xEventGroupWaitBits()` returned because the calling task's
  unblock condition was met, then the returned value is the value of the
  event group at the time the calling task's unblock condition was met
  (before any bits were automatically cleared if `xClearOnExit` was `pdTRUE`).
  In this case the returned value will also meet the unblock condition.

  If `xEventGroupWaitBits()` returned because the block time specified by
  the `xTicksToWait` parameter expired, then the returned value is the value
  of the event group at the time the block time expired. In this case the
  returned value will not meet the unblock condition.


### 9.3.5 The xEventGroupGetStaticBuffer() API Function

The `xEventGroupGetStaticBuffer()` API function provides a method to retrieve a pointer
to a buffer of a statically created event group. It is the same buffer that is supplied
at the time of creation of the event group.

*Note: Never call `xEventGroupGetStaticBuffer()` from an interrupt service
routine.


<a name="list9.5" title="Listing 9.5 The xEventGroupGetStaticBuffer() API function prototype"></a>

```c
BaseType_t xEventGroupGetStaticBuffer( EventGroupHandle_t xEventGroup,

StaticEventGroup_t ** ppxEventGroupBuffer );
```
***Listing 9.5*** *The xEventGroupGetStaticBuffer() API function prototype*


**xEventGroupGetStaticBuffer() parameters and return value**

- `xEventGroup`

  The event group for which to retrieve the buffer. This event group must
  be created by `xEventGroupCreateStatic()`.

- `ppxEventGroupBuffer`

  Used to return a pointer to the event groups's data structure buffer.
  It is the same buffer that is supplied at the time of creation.

- Return Value

  There are two possible return values:

  - `pdTRUE` will be returned if the buffer was successfully retrieved.

  - `pdFALSE` will be returned if the buffer was not successfully retrieved.

<a name="example9.1" title="Example 9.1 Experimenting with event groups"></a>
---
***Example 9.1*** *Experimenting with event groups*

---

This example demonstrates how to:

- Create an event group.
- Set bits in an event group from an interrupt service routine.
- Set bits in an event group from a task.
- Block on an event group.

The effect of the `xEventGroupWaitBits()` `xWaitForAllBits` parameter is
demonstrated by first executing the example with `xWaitForAllBits` set to
`pdFALSE`, and then executing the example with `xWaitForAllBits` set to
`pdTRUE`.

Event bit 0 and event bit 1 are set from a task. Event bit 2 is set from
an interrupt service routine. These three bits are given descriptive
names using the \#define statements shown in Listing 9.6.


<a name="list9.6" title="Listing 9.6 Event bit definitions used in Example 9.1"></a>

```c
/* Definitions for the event bits in the event group. */
#define mainFIRST_TASK_BIT ( 1UL << 0UL )  /* Event bit 0, set by a task */
#define mainSECOND_TASK_BIT ( 1UL << 1UL ) /* Event bit 1, set by a task */
#define mainISR_BIT ( 1UL << 2UL )         /* Event bit 2, set by an ISR */
```
***Listing 9.6*** *Event bit definitions used in Example 9.1*


Listing 9.7 shows the implementation of the task that sets event bit 0
and event bit 1. It sits in a loop, repeatedly setting one bit, then the
other, with a delay of 200 milliseconds between each call to
`xEventGroupSetBits()`. A string is printed out before each bit is set to
allow the sequence of execution to be seen in the console.


<a name="list9.7" title="Listing 9.7 The task that sets two bits in the event group in Example 9.1"></a>

```c
static void vEventBitSettingTask( void *pvParameters )
{
    const TickType_t xDelay200ms = pdMS_TO_TICKS( 200UL );

    for( ;; )
    {
        /* Delay for a short while before starting the next loop. */
        vTaskDelay( xDelay200ms );

        /* Print out a message to say event bit 0 is about to be set by the
           task, then set event bit 0. */
        vPrintString( "Bit setting task -\t about to set bit 0.\r\n" );
        xEventGroupSetBits( xEventGroup, mainFIRST_TASK_BIT );

        /* Delay for a short while before setting the other bit. */
        vTaskDelay( xDelay200ms );

        /* Print out a message to say event bit 1 is about to be set by the
           task, then set event bit 1. */
        vPrintString( "Bit setting task -\t about to set bit 1.\r\n" );
        xEventGroupSetBits( xEventGroup, mainSECOND_TASK_BIT );
    }
}
```
***Listing 9.7*** *The task that sets two bits in the event group in Example 9.1*


Listing 9.8 shows the implementation of the interrupt service routine
that sets bit 2 in the event group. Again, a string is printed out
before the bit is set to allow the sequence of execution to be seen in
the console. In this case however, because console output should not be
performed directly in an interrupt service routine,
`xTimerPendFunctionCallFromISR()` is used to perform the output in the
context of the RTOS daemon task.

As in previous examples, the interrupt service routine is triggered by a
simple periodic task that forces a software interrupt. In this example,
the interrupt is generated every 500 milliseconds.


<a name="list9.8" title="Listing 9.8 The ISR that sets bit 2 in the event group in Example 9.1"></a>

```c
static uint32_t ulEventBitSettingISR( void )
{
    /* The string is not printed within the interrupt service routine, but is
       instead sent to the RTOS daemon task for printing. It is therefore
       declared static to ensure the compiler does not allocate the string on
       the stack of the ISR, as the ISR's stack frame will not exist when the
       string is printed from the daemon task. */
    static const char *pcString = "Bit setting ISR -\t about to set bit 2.\r\n";
    BaseType_t xHigherPriorityTaskWoken = pdFALSE;

    /* Print out a message to say bit 2 is about to be set. Messages cannot
       be printed from an ISR, so defer the actual output to the RTOS daemon
       task by pending a function call to run in the context of the RTOS
       daemon task. */
    xTimerPendFunctionCallFromISR( vPrintStringFromDaemonTask,
                                   ( void * ) pcString,
                                   0,
                                   &xHigherPriorityTaskWoken );

    /* Set bit 2 in the event group. */
    xEventGroupSetBitsFromISR( xEventGroup,
                               mainISR_BIT,
                               &xHigherPriorityTaskWoken );

    /* xTimerPendFunctionCallFromISR() and xEventGroupSetBitsFromISR() both
       write to the timer command queue, and both used the same
       xHigherPriorityTaskWoken variable. If writing to the timer command
       queue resulted in the RTOS daemon task leaving the Blocked state, and
       if the priority of the RTOS daemon task is higher than the priority of
       the currently executing task (the task this interrupt interrupted) then
       xHigherPriorityTaskWoken will have been set to pdTRUE.

       xHigherPriorityTaskWoken is used as the parameter to
       portYIELD_FROM_ISR(). If xHigherPriorityTaskWoken equals pdTRUE, then
       calling portYIELD_FROM_ISR() will request a context switch. If
       xHigherPriorityTaskWoken is still pdFALSE, then calling
       portYIELD_FROM_ISR() will have no effect.

       The implementation of portYIELD_FROM_ISR() used by the Windows port
       includes a return statement, which is why this function does not
       explicitly return a value. */

    portYIELD_FROM_ISR( xHigherPriorityTaskWoken );
}
```
***Listing 9.8*** *The ISR that sets bit 2 in the event group in Example 9.1*


Listing 9.9 shows the implementation of the task that calls
`xEventGroupWaitBits()` to block on the event group. The task prints out a
string for each bit that is set in the event group.

The `xEventGroupWaitBits()` `xClearOnExit` parameter is set to `pdTRUE`, so
the event bit, or bits, that caused the call to `xEventGroupWaitBits()` to
return will be cleared automatically before `xEventGroupWaitBits()`
returns.


<a name="list9.9" title="Listing 9.9 The task that blocks to wait for event bits to become set in Example 9.1"></a>

***Listing 9.9*** *The task that blocks to wait for event bits to become set in Example 9.1*


The `main()` function creates the event group, and the tasks, before
starting the scheduler. See Listing 9.10 for its implementation. The
priority of the task that reads from the event group is higher than the
priority of the task that writes to the event group, ensuring the
reading task will pre-empt the writing task each time the reading task's
unblock condition is met.

The output produced when Example 9.1 is executed with the
`xEventGroupWaitBits()` `xWaitForAllBits` parameter set to `pdFALSE` is shown
in Figure 9.3. In Figure 9.3, it can be seen that, because the
`xWaitForAllBits` parameter in the call to `xEventGroupWaitBits()` was set
to `pdFALSE`, the task that reads from the event group leaves the Blocked
state and executes immediately every time any of the event bits are set.

The output produced when Example 9.1 is executed with the
`xEventGroupWaitBits()` `xWaitForAllBits` parameter set to `pdTRUE` is shown
in Figure 9.4. In Figure 9.4 it can be seen that, because the
`xWaitForAllBits` parameter was set to `pdTRUE`, the task that reads from
the event group only leaves the Blocked state after all three of the
event bits are set.
