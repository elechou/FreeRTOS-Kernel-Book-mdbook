## 9.4 Task Synchronization Using an Event Group

Sometimes the design of an application requires two or more tasks to
synchronize with each other. For example, consider a design where Task A
receives an event, then delegates some of the processing necessitated by
the event to three other tasks: Task B, Task C and Task D. If Task A
cannot receive another event until tasks B, C and D have all completed
processing the previous event, then all four tasks will need to
synchronize with each other. Each task's synchronization point will be
after that task has completed its processing, and cannot proceed further
until each of the other tasks have done the same. Task A can only
receive another event after all four tasks have reached their
synchronization point.

A less abstract example of the need for this type of task
synchronization is found in one of the FreeRTOS+TCP demonstration
projects. The demonstration shares a TCP socket between two tasks; one
task sends data to the socket, and a different task receives data from
the same socket[^25]. It is not safe for either task to close the TCP
socket until it is sure the other task will not attempt to access the
socket again. If either of the two tasks wishes to close the socket,
then it must inform the other task of its intent, and then wait for the
other task to stop using the socket before proceeding. The scenario
where it is the task that sends data to the socket that wishes to close
the socket is demonstrated by the pseudo code shown in Listing 9.10.

[^25]: At the time of writing, this is the only way a single
FreeRTOS+TCP socket can be shared between tasks.

The scenario demonstrated by Listing 9.10 is trivial, as there are only
two tasks that need to synchronize with each other, but it is easy to
see how the scenario would become more complex, and require more tasks
to join the synchronization, if other tasks were performing processing
that was dependent on the socket being open.

        xSocket = FreeRTOS_socket( ... );

***Listing 9.11*** *Pseudo code for two tasks that synchronize with each other to ensure a shared TCP socket is no longer in use by either task before the socket is closed*


An event group can be used to create a synchronization point:

- Each task that must participate in the synchronization is assigned a
  unique event bit within the event group.

- Each task sets its own event bit when it reaches the synchronization
  point.

- Having set its own event bit, each task blocks on the event group to
  wait for the event bits that represent all the other synchronizing
  tasks to also become set.

However, the `xEventGroupSetBits()` and `xEventGroupWaitBits()` API
functions cannot be used in this scenario. If they were used, then the
setting of a bit (to indicate a task had reached its synchronization
point) and the testing of bits (to determine if the other synchronizing
tasks had reached their synchronization point) would be performed as two
separate operations. To see why that would be a problem, consider a
scenario where Task A, Task B and Task C attempt to synchronize using an
event group:

1. Task A and Task B have already reached the synchronization point, so
   their event bits are set in the event group, and they are in the
   Blocked state to wait for task C's event bit to also become set.

2. Task C reaches the synchronization point, and uses
   `xEventGroupSetBits()` to set its bit in the event group. As soon as
   Task C's bit is set, Task A and Task B leave the Blocked state, and
   clear all three event bits.

3. Task C then calls `xEventGroupWaitBits()` to wait for all three event
   bits to become set, but by that time, all three event bits have
   already been cleared, Task A and Task B have left their respective
   synchronization points, and so the synchronization has failed.

To successfully use an event group to create a synchronization point,
the setting of an event bit, and the subsequent testing of event bits,
must be performed as a single uninterruptable operation. The
`xEventGroupSync()` API function is provided for that purpose.


### 9.4.1 The xEventGroupSync() API Function

`xEventGroupSync()` is provided to allow two or more tasks to use an event
group to synchronize with each other. The function allows a task to set
one or more event bits in an event group, then wait for a combination of
event bits to become set in the same event group, as a single
uninterruptable operation.

The `xEventGroupSync()` `uxBitsToWaitFor` parameter specifies the calling
task's unblock condition. The event bits specified by `uxBitsToWaitFor`
will be cleared back to zero before `xEventGroupSync()` returns, if
`xEventGroupSync()` returned because the unblock condition had been met.


<a name="list9.12" title="Listing 9.12 The xEventGroupSync() API function prototype"></a>

```c
EventBits_t xEventGroupSync( EventGroupHandle_t xEventGroup,
                             const EventBits_t uxBitsToSet,
                             const EventBits_t uxBitsToWaitFor,
                             TickType_t xTicksToWait );
```
***Listing 9.12*** *The xEventGroupSync() API function prototype*


**xEventGroupSync() parameters and return value**

- `xEventGroup`

  The handle of the event group in which event bits are to be set, and
  then tested. The event group handle will have been returned from the
  call to `xEventGroupCreate()` used to create the event group.

- `uxBitsToSet`

  A bit mask that specifies the event bit, or event bits, to set to
  1 in the event group. The value of the event group is updated by bitwise
  ORing the event group's existing value with the value passed in
  `uxBitsToSet`.

  As an example, setting `uxBitsToSet` to 0x04 (binary 0100) will result
  in event bit 2 becoming set (if it was not already set), while leaving
  all the other event bits in the event group unchanged.

- `uxBitsToWaitFor`

  A bit mask that specifies the event bit, or event bits, to test
  in the event group.

  For example, if the calling task wants to wait for event bits 0, 1
  and 2 to become set in the event group, then set `uxBitsToWaitFor` to 0x07
  (binary 111).

- `xTicksToWait`

  The maximum amount of time the task should remain in the Blocked
  state to wait for its unblock condition to be met.

  `xEventGroupSync()` will return immediately if `xTicksToWait` is zero, or
  the unblock condition is met at the time `xEventGroupSync()` is
  called.

  The block time is specified in tick periods, so the absolute time it
  represents is dependent on the tick frequency. The macro `pdMS_TO_TICKS()`
  can be used to convert a time specified in milliseconds into a time
  specified in ticks.

  Setting `xTicksToWait` to `portMAX_DELAY` will cause the task to wait
  indefinitely (without timing out), provided `INCLUDE_vTaskSuspend` is set
  to 1 in FreeRTOSConfig.h.

- Returned Value

  If `xEventGroupSync()` returned because the calling task's unblock
  condition was met, then the returned value is the value of the event
  group at the time the calling task's unblock condition was met (before
  any bits were automatically cleared back to zero). In this case the
  returned value will also meet the calling task's unblock condition.

  If `xEventGroupSync()` returned because the block time specified by the
  `xTicksToWait` parameter expired, then the returned value is the value of
  the event group at the time the block time expired. In this case the
  returned value will not meet the calling task's unblock
  condition.

***Example 9.2*** *Synchronizing tasks*

---

Example 9.2 uses `xEventGroupSync()` to synchronize three instances of a
single task implementation. The task parameter is used to pass into each
instance the event bit the task will set when it calls
`xEventGroupSync()`.

The task prints a message before calling `xEventGroupSync()`, and again
after the call to `xEventGroupSync()` has returned. Each message includes
a time stamp. This allows the sequence of execution to be observed in
the output produced. A pseudo random delay is used to prevent all the
tasks reaching the synchronization point at the same time.

See Listing 9.12 for the task's implementation.

The output produced when Example 9.2 is executed is shown in Figure 9.5.
It can be seen that, even though each task reaches the synchronization
point at a different (pseudo random) time, each task exits the
synchronization point at the same time[^26] (which is the time at which
the last task reached the synchronization point).

[^26]: Figure 9.5 shows the example running in the FreeRTOS Windows port,
which does not provide true real time behavior (especially when
using Windows system calls to print to the console), and will
therefore show some timing variation.
