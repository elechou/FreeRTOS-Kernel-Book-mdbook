## 9.2 Characteristics of an Event Group

### 9.2.1 Event Groups, Event Flags and Event Bits

An event 'flag' is a Boolean (1 or 0) value used to indicate if an event
has occurred or not. An event 'group' is a set of event flags.

An event flag can only be 1 or 0, allowing the state of an event flag to
be stored in a single bit, and the state of all the event flags in an
event group to be stored in a single variable; the state of each event
flag in an event group is represented by a single bit in a variable of
type `EventBits_t`. For that reason, event flags are also known as event
'bits'. If a bit is set to 1 in the `EventBits_t` variable, then the event
represented by that bit has occurred. If a bit is set to 0 in the
`EventBits_t` variable, then the event represented by that bit has not
occurred.

Figure 9.1 shows how individual event flags are mapped to individual bits
in a variable of type `EventBits_t`.

As an example, if the value of an event group is 0x92 (binary 1001 0010)
then only event bits 1, 4 and 7 are set, so only the events represented
by bits 1, 4 and 7 have occurred. Figure 9.2 shows a variable of type
`EventBits_t` that has event bits 1, 4 and 7 set, and all the other event
bits clear, giving the event group a value of 0x92.

It is up to the application writer to assign a meaning to individual
bits within an event group. For example, the application writer might
create an event group, then:

- Define bit 0 within the event group to mean "a message has been
  received from the network".

- Define bit 1 within the event group to mean "a message is ready to
  be sent onto the network".

- Define bit 2 within the event group to mean "abort the current
  network connection".


### 9.2.2 More About the EventBits\_t Data Type

The number of event bits in an event group is dependent on the
`configTICK_TYPE_WIDTH_IN_BITS` compile time configuration constant in
FreeRTOSConfig.h[^24]:

[^24]: `configTICK_TYPE_WIDTH_IN_BITS` configures the type used to hold the RTOS
tick count, so would seem unrelated to the event groups feature. Its
effect on the `EventBits_t` type is a consequence of FreeRTOS's
internal implementation, and desirable as it is to set `configTICK_TYPE_WIDTH_IN_BITS`
to `TICK_TYPE_WIDTH_16_BITS`, this should be done only when FreeRTOS is executing on an
architecture that can handle 16-bit types more efficiently than
32-bit types.

- If `configTICK_TYPE_WIDTH_IN_BITS` is `TICK_TYPE_WIDTH_16_BITS`, then each
  event group contains 8 usable event bits.

- If `configTICK_TYPE_WIDTH_IN_BITS` is `TICK_TYPE_WIDTH_32_BITS`, then each event group contains 24
  usable event bits.

- If `configTICK_TYPE_WIDTH_IN_BITS` is `TICK_TYPE_WIDTH_64_BITS`, then each
  event group contains 56 usable event bits.


### 9.2.3 Access by Multiple Tasks

Event groups are objects in their own right that can be accessed by any
task or ISR that knows of their existence. Any number of tasks can set
bits in the same event group, and any number of tasks can read bits from
the same event group.


### 9.2.4 A Practical Example of Using an Event Group

The implementation of the FreeRTOS+TCP TCP/IP stack provides a practical
example of how an event group can be used to simultaneously simplify a
design, and minimize resource usage.

A TCP socket must respond to many different events. Examples of events
include accept events, bind events, read events and close events. The
events a socket can expect at any given time are dependent on the state
of the socket. For example, if a socket has been created, but not yet
bound to an address, then it can expect to receive a bind event, but
would not expect to receive a read event (it cannot read data if it does
not have an address).

The state of a FreeRTOS+TCP socket is held in a structure called
`FreeRTOS_Socket_t`. The structure contains an event group that has an
event bit defined for each event the socket must process. FreeRTOS+TCP
API calls that block to wait for an event, or group of events, simply
block on the event group.

The event group also contains an 'abort' bit, allowing a TCP connection
to be aborted, no matter which event the socket is waiting for at the
time.
