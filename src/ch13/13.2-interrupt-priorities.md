## 13.2 Interrupt Priorities

If the FreeRTOS port in use supports interrupt nesting, and the service
routine for an interrupt makes use of the FreeRTOS API, then it is
*essential* the interrupt's priority is set at or below
`configMAX_SYSCALL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY`, as described in section 7.8,
Interrupt Nesting. Failure to do this will result in ineffective
critical sections, which in turn will result in intermittent failures.

Take particular care if running FreeRTOS on a processor where:

- Interrupt priorities default to having the highest possible
  priority, which is the case on some ARM Cortex processors, and
  possibly others. On such processors, the priority of an interrupt
  that uses the FreeRTOS API cannot be left uninitialized.

- Numerically high priority numbers represent logically low interrupt
  priorities, which may seem counterintuitive, and therefore cause
  confusion. Again this is the case on ARM Cortex processors, and
  possibly others.

- For example, on such a processor an interrupt that is executing at
  priority 5 can itself be interrupted by an interrupt that has a
  priority of 4. Therefore, if `configMAX_SYSCALL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY` is
  set to 5, any interrupt that uses the FreeRTOS API can only be
  assigned a priority numerically higher than or equal to 5. In that
  case, interrupt priorities of 5 or 6 would be valid, but an
  interrupt priority of 3 is definitely invalid.

- Different library implementations expect the priority of an
  interrupt to be specified in a different way. Again, this is particularly
  relevant to libraries that target ARM Cortex processors, where
  interrupt priorities are bit shifted before being written to the
  hardware registers. Some libraries will perform the bit shift
  themselves, whereas others expect the bit shift to be performed
  before the priority is passed into the library function.

- Different implementations of the same architecture implement a
  different number of interrupt priority bits. For example, a Cortex-M
  processor from one manufacturer may implement 3 priority bits, while
  a Cortex-M processor from another manufacturer may implement 4
  priority bits.

- The bits that define the priority of an interrupt can be split
  between bits that define a pre-emption priority, and bits that
  define a sub-priority. Ensure all the bits are assigned to
  specifying a pre-emption priority, so that sub-priorities are not used.

In some FreeRTOS ports, `configMAX_SYSCALL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY` has the
alternative name `configMAX_API_CALL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY`.
