## 6.6 The Timer ID

Each software timer has an ID, which is a tag value that can be used by
the application writer for any purpose. The ID is stored in a void
pointer (`void *`), so it can store an integer value directly, point to any
other object, or be used as a function pointer.

An initial value is assigned to the ID when the software timer is
created, after which the ID can be updated using the `vTimerSetTimerID()`
API function, and queried using the `pvTimerGetTimerID()` API function.

Unlike other software timer API functions, `vTimerSetTimerID()` and
`pvTimerGetTimerID()` access the software timer directlyâ€”they do not send
a command to the timer command queue.


### 6.6.1 The vTimerSetTimerID() API Function


<a name="list6.8" title="Listing 6.8 The vTimerSetTimerID() API function prototype"></a>

```c
void vTimerSetTimerID( const TimerHandle_t xTimer, void *pvNewID );
```
***Listing 6.8*** *The vTimerSetTimerID() API function prototype*


**vTimerSetTimerID() parameters**

- `xTimer`

  The handle of the software timer being updated with a new ID value.
  The handle will have been returned from the call to `xTimerCreate()` used
  to create the software timer.

- `pvNewID`

  The value to which the software timer's ID will be set.


### 6.6.2 The pvTimerGetTimerID() API Function


<a name="list6.9" title="Listing 6.9 The pvTimerGetTimerID() API function prototype"></a>

```c
void *pvTimerGetTimerID( const TimerHandle_t xTimer );
```
***Listing 6.9*** *The pvTimerGetTimerID() API function prototype*


**pvTimerGetTimerID() parameters and return value**

- `xTimer`

  The handle of the software timer being queried. The handle will have
  been returned from the call to `xTimerCreate()` used to create the
  software timer.

- Return value

  The ID of the software timer being queried.

***Example 6.2*** *Using the callback function parameter and the software timer ID*

---

The same callback function can be assigned to more than one software
timer. When that is done, the callback function parameter is used to
determine which software timer expired.

Example 6.1 used two separate callback functions; one callback function
was used by the one-shot timer, and the other callback function was used
by the auto-reload timer. Example 6.2 creates similar functionality to
that created by Example 6.1, but assigns a single callback function to
both software timers.

The `main()` function used by Example 6.2 is almost identical to the `main()`
function used in Example 6.1. The only difference is where the software
timers are created. This difference is shown in Listing 6.10, where
`prvTimerCallback()` is used as the callback function for both timers.


<a name="list6.10" title="Listing 6.10 Creating the timers used in Example 6.2"></a>

```c
/* Create the one shot timer software timer, storing the handle in
   xOneShotTimer. */
xOneShotTimer = xTimerCreate( "OneShot",
                              mainONE_SHOT_TIMER_PERIOD,
                              pdFALSE,
                              /* The timer's ID is initialized to NULL. */
                              NULL,
                              /* prvTimerCallback() is used by both timers. */
                              prvTimerCallback );

/* Create the auto-reload software timer, storing the handle in
   xAutoReloadTimer */
xAutoReloadTimer = xTimerCreate( "AutoReload",
                                 mainAUTO_RELOAD_TIMER_PERIOD,
                                 pdTRUE,
                                 /* The timer's ID is initialized to NULL. */
                                 NULL,
                                 /* prvTimerCallback() is used by both timers. */
                                 prvTimerCallback );
```
***Listing 6.10*** *Creating the timers used in Example 6.2*

`prvTimerCallback()` will execute when either timer expires. The
implementation of `prvTimerCallback()` uses the function's parameter to
determine if it was called because the one-shot timer expired, or
because the auto-reload timer expired.

`prvTimerCallback()` also demonstrates how to use the software timer ID as
timer specific storage; each software timer keeps a count of the number
of times it has expired in its own ID, and the auto-reload timer uses
the count to stop itself the fifth time it executes.

The implementation of `prvTimerCallback()` is shown in Listing 6.9.


<a name="list6.11" title="Listing 6.11 The timer callback function used in Example 6.2"></a>

```c
static void prvTimerCallback( TimerHandle_t xTimer )
{
    TickType_t xTimeNow;
    uint32_t ulExecutionCount;

    /* A count of the number of times this software timer has expired is
       stored in the timer's ID. Obtain the ID, increment it, then save it as
       the new ID value. The ID is a void pointer, so is cast to a uint32_t. */
    ulExecutionCount = ( uint32_t ) pvTimerGetTimerID( xTimer );
    ulExecutionCount++;
    vTimerSetTimerID( xTimer, ( void * ) ulExecutionCount );

    /* Obtain the current tick count. */
    xTimeNow = xTaskGetTickCount();

    /* The handle of the one-shot timer was stored in xOneShotTimer when the
       timer was created. Compare the handle passed into this function with
       xOneShotTimer to determine if it was the one-shot or auto-reload timer
       that expired, then output a string to show the time at which the
       callback was executed. */
    if( xTimer == xOneShotTimer )
    {
        vPrintStringAndNumber( "One-shot timer callback executing", xTimeNow );
    }
    else
    {
        /* xTimer did not equal xOneShotTimer, so it must have been the
           auto-reload timer that expired. */
        vPrintStringAndNumber( "Auto-reload timer callback executing", xTimeNow);

        if( ulExecutionCount == 5 )
        {
            /* Stop the auto-reload timer after it has executed 5 times. This
               callback function executes in the context of the RTOS daemon
               task so must not call any functions that might place the daemon
               task into the Blocked state. Therefore a block time of 0 is
               used. */
            xTimerStop( xTimer, 0 );
        }
    }
}
```
***Listing 6.11*** *The timer callback function used in Example 6.2*


The output produced by Example 6.2 is shown in Figure 6.8. It can be seen
that the auto-reload timer only executes five times.
