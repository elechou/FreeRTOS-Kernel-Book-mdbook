##  6.5 Creating and Starting a Software Timer

### 6.5.1 The xTimerCreate() API Function

FreeRTOS also includes the `xTimerCreateStatic()` function, which
allocates the memory required to create a timer statically at compile
time: A software timer must be explicitly created before it can be used.

Software timers are referenced by variables of type `TimerHandle_t`.
`xTimerCreate()` is used to create a software timer and returns a
`TimerHandle_t` to reference the software timer it creates. Software
timers are created in the Dormant state.

Software timers can be created before the scheduler is running, or from
a task after the scheduler has been started.

[Section 2.5: Data Types and Coding Style Guide](ch02.md#25-data-types-and-coding-style-guide) describes the data types and naming conventions used.

```c
TimerHandle_t xTimerCreate( const char * const pcTimerName,
                            const TickType_t xTimerPeriodInTicks,
                            const BaseType_t xAutoReload,
                            void * const pvTimerID,
                            TimerCallbackFunction_t pxCallbackFunction );
```
***Listing 6.3*** *The xTimerCreate() API function prototype*

**xTimerCreate() parameters and return value**

- `pcTimerName`

  A descriptive name for the timer. This is not used by FreeRTOS in
  any way. It is included purely as a debugging aid. Identifying a timer
  by a human readable name is much simpler than attempting to identify it
  by its handle.

- `xTimerPeriodInTicks`

  The timer's period specified in ticks. The `pdMS_TO_TICKS()` macro can
  be used to convert a time specified in milliseconds into a time
  specified in ticks. Cannot be 0.

- `xAutoReload`

  Set `xAutoReload` to `pdTRUE` to create an auto-reload timer. Set
  `xAutoReload` to `pdFALSE` to create a one-shot timer.

- `pvTimerID`

  Each software timer has an ID value. The ID is a void pointer,
  and can be used by the application writer for any purpose. The ID is
  particularly useful when the same callback function is used by more than
  one software timer, as it can be used to provide timer specific storage.
  Use of a timer's ID is demonstrated in an example in this
  chapter.

  `pvTimerID` sets an initial value for the ID of the task being created.

- `pxCallbackFunction`

  Software timer callback functions are simply C functions that
  conform to the prototype shown in Listing 6.1. The `pxCallbackFunction`
  parameter is a pointer to the function (in effect, just the function
  name) to use as the callback function for the software timer being
  created.

- Return value

  If NULL is returned, then the software timer cannot be created
  because there is insufficient heap memory available for FreeRTOS to
  allocate the necessary data structure.

  If a non-NULL value is returned it indicates that the software timer has
  been created successfully. The returned value is the handle of the
  created timer.

  Chapter 3 provides more information on heap memory management.


### 6.5.2 The xTimerStart() API Function

`xTimerStart()` is used to start a software timer that is in the Dormant
state, or reset (re-start) a software timer that is in the Running
state. `xTimerStop()` is used to stop a software timer that is in the
Running state. Stopping a software timer is the same as transitioning
the timer into the Dormant state.

`xTimerStart()` can be called before the scheduler is started, but when
this is done, the software timer will not actually start until the time
at which the scheduler starts.

> *Note: Never call `xTimerStart()` from an interrupt service routine. The
> interrupt-safe version `xTimerStartFromISR()` should be used in its
> place.*


<a name="list6.4" title="Listing 6.4 The xTimerStart() API function prototype"></a>

```c
BaseType_t xTimerStart( TimerHandle_t xTimer, TickType_t xTicksToWait );
```
***Listing 6.4*** *The xTimerStart() API function prototype*


**xTimerStart() parameters and return value**

- `xTimer`

  The handle of the software timer being started or reset. The handle
  will have been returned from the call to `xTimerCreate()` used to create
  the software timer.

- `xTicksToWait`

  `xTimerStart()` uses the timer command queue to send the 'start a
  timer' command to the daemon task. `xTicksToWait` specifies the maximum
  amount of time the calling task should remain in the Blocked state to
  wait for space to become available on the timer command queue, should
  the queue already be full.

  `xTimerStart()` will return immediately if `xTicksToWait` is zero and the
  timer command queue is already full.

  The block time is specified in tick periods, so the absolute time it
  represents is dependent on the tick frequency. The macro `pdMS_TO_TICKS()`
  can be used to convert a time specified in milliseconds into a time
  specified in ticks.

  If `INCLUDE_vTaskSuspend` is set to 1 in `FreeRTOSConfig.h` then setting
  `xTicksToWait` to `portMAX_DELAY` will result in the calling task remaining
  in the Blocked state indefinitely (without a timeout) to wait for space
  to become available in the timer command queue.

  If `xTimerStart()` is called before the scheduler has been started then
  the value of `xTicksToWait` is ignored, and `xTimerStart()` behaves as if
  `xTicksToWait` had been set to zero.

- Return value

  There are two possible return values:

  - `pdPASS`

    `pdPASS` will be returned only if the 'start a timer' command was
    successfully sent to the timer command queue.

    If the priority of the daemon task is above the priority of the task
    that called `xTimerStart()`, then the scheduler will ensure the start
    command is processed before `xTimerStart()` returns. This is because the
    daemon task will pre-empt the task that called `xTimerStart()` as soon as
    there is data in the timer command queue.

    If a block time was specified (`xTicksToWait` was not zero), then it is
    possible the calling task was placed into the Blocked state to wait for
    space to become available in the timer command queue before the function
    returned, but data was successfully written to the timer command queue
    before the block time expired.

  - `pdFAIL`

    `pdFAIL` will be returned if the 'start a timer' command could not be
    written to the timer command queue because the queue was already
    full.

    If a block time was specified (`xTicksToWait` was not zero) then the
    calling task will have been placed into the Blocked state to wait for
    the daemon task to make room in the timer command queue, but the
    specified block time expired before that happened.

This example creates and starts a one-shot timer and an auto-reload
timerâ€”as shown in Listing 6.5.

***Listing 6.5*** *Creating and starting the timers used in Example 6.1*


The timers' callback functions just print a message each time they are
called. The implementation of the one-shot timer callback function is
shown in Listing 6.6. The implementation of the auto-reload timer
callback function is shown in Listing 6.7.


<a name="list6.5" title="Listing 6.6 The callback function used by the one-shot timer in Example 6.1"></a>

```c
static void prvOneShotTimerCallback( TimerHandle_t xTimer )
{
    TickType_t xTimeNow;

    /* Obtain the current tick count. */
    xTimeNow = xTaskGetTickCount();

    /* Output a string to show the time at which the callback was executed. */
    vPrintStringAndNumber( "One-shot timer callback executing", xTimeNow );

    /* File scope variable. */
    ulCallCount++;
}
```
***Listing 6.6*** *The callback function used by the one-shot timer in Example 6.1*


<a name="list6.7" title="Listing 6.7 The callback function used by the auto-reload timer in Example 6.1"></a>

```c
static void prvAutoReloadTimerCallback( TimerHandle_t xTimer )
{
    TickType_t xTimeNow;

    /* Obtain the current tick count. */
    xTimeNow = xTaskGetTickCount();

    /* Output a string to show the time at which the callback was executed. */
    vPrintStringAndNumber( "Auto-reload timer callback executing", xTimeNow);

    ulCallCount++;
}
```
***Listing 6.7*** *The callback function used by the auto-reload timer in Example 6.1*

Executing this example produces the output shown in Figure 6.7. Figure 6.7
shows the auto-reload timer's callback function executing with a fixed
period of 500 ticks (`mainAUTO_RELOAD_TIMER_PERIOD` is set to 500 in
Listing 6.5), and the one-shot timer's callback function executing only
once, when the tick count is 3333 (`mainONE_SHOT_TIMER_PERIOD` is set to
3333 in Listing 6.5).
