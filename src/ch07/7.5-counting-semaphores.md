## 7.5 Counting Semaphores

Just as binary semaphores can be thought of as queues that have a length
of one, counting semaphores can be thought of as queues that have a
length of more than one. Tasks are not interested in the data that is
stored in the queueâ€”just the number of items in the queue.
`configUSE_COUNTING_SEMAPHORES` must be set to 1 in FreeRTOSConfig.h for
counting semaphores to be available.

Each time a counting semaphore is 'given', another space in its queue is
used. The number of items in the queue is the semaphore's 'count' value.

Counting semaphores are typically used for two things:

1. Counting events[^18]

   In this scenario, an event handler will 'give' a semaphore each time
   an event occurs, causing the semaphore's count value to be
   incremented on each 'give'. A task will 'take' a semaphore each time
   it processes an event, causing the semaphore's count value to be
   decremented on each 'take'. The count value is the difference
   between the number of events that have occurred and the number that
   have been processed. This mechanism is shown in Figure 7.8.

   Counting semaphores that are used to count events are created with
   an initial count value of zero.

   [^18]: It is more efficient to count events using a direct to task
   notification than it is using a counting semaphore. Direct to task
   notifications are not covered until Chapter 10.

1. Resource management.

   In this scenario, the count value indicates the number of resources
   available. To obtain control of a resource, a task must first obtain
   a semaphore, which decrements the semaphore's count value. When the count
   value reaches zero, there are no free resources. When a task
   finishes with the resource, it 'gives' the semaphore
   back, which increments the semaphore's count value.

   Counting semaphores that are used to manage resources are created so
   that their initial count value equals the number of resources that
   are available. Chapter 7 covers using semaphores to manage
   resources.

### 7.5.1 The xSemaphoreCreateCounting() API Function

FreeRTOS also includes the `xSemaphoreCreateCountingStatic()`
function, which allocates the memory required to create a counting
semaphore statically at compile time: Handles to all the various types
of FreeRTOS semaphores are stored in a variable of type `SemaphoreHandle_t`.

Before a semaphore can be used, it must be created. To create a counting
semaphore, use the `xSemaphoreCreateCounting()` API function.


<a name="list7.11" title="Listing 7.11 The xSemaphoreCreateCounting() API function prototype"></a>

```c
SemaphoreHandle_t xSemaphoreCreateCounting( UBaseType_t uxMaxCount,
                                            UBaseType_t uxInitialCount );
```
***Listing 7.11*** *The xSemaphoreCreateCounting() API function prototype*


**xSemaphoreCreateCounting() parameters and return value**

- `uxMaxCount`

   The maximum value to which the semaphore will count. To continue
   the queue analogy, the `uxMaxCount` value is effectively the length of the
   queue.

   When the semaphore is to be used to count or latch events, `uxMaxCount`
   is the maximum number of events that can be latched.

   When the semaphore is to be used to manage access to a collection of
   resources, `uxMaxCount` should be set to the total number of resources
   that are available.

- `uxInitialCount`

  The initial count value of the semaphore after it has been created.

  When the semaphore is to be used to count or latch events,
  `uxInitialCount` should be set to zero (because when the semaphore
  is created we assume no events have occurred yet).

  When the semaphore is to be used to manage access to a collection of
  resources, `uxInitialCount` should be set to equal `uxMaxCount` (because
  when the semaphore is created we assume all the resources are available).

- Return value

  If NULL is returned, the semaphore cannot be created because
  there is insufficient heap memory available for FreeRTOS to allocate the
  semaphore data structures. Chapter 3 provides more information on heap
  memory management.

  If a non-NULL value is returned, it indicates that the semaphore has been
  created successfully. The returned value should be stored as the handle
  to the created semaphore.

***Example 7.2*** *Using a counting semaphore to synchronize a task with an interrupt*

---

Example 7.2 improves on the Example 7.1 implementation by using a counting
semaphore in place of the binary semaphore. `main()` is changed to include
a call to `xSemaphoreCreateCounting()` in place of the call to
`xSemaphoreCreateBinary()`. The new API call is shown in Listing 7.12.


<a name="list7.12" title="Listing 7.12 The call to xSemaphoreCreateCounting() used to create the counting semaphore in Example 7.2"></a>

```c
/* Before a semaphore is used it must be explicitly created. In this example a
   counting semaphore is created. The semaphore is created to have a maximum
   count value of 10, and an initial count value of 0. */
xCountingSemaphore = xSemaphoreCreateCounting( 10, 0 );
```
***Listing 7.12*** *The call to xSemaphoreCreateCounting() used to create the counting semaphore in Example 7.2*


To simulate multiple events occurring at high frequency, the interrupt
service routine is changed to 'give' the semaphore more than once per
interrupt. Each event is latched in the semaphore's count value. The
modified interrupt service routine is shown in Listing 7.13.


<a name="list7.13" title="Listing 7.13 The implementation of the interrupt service routine used by Example 7.2"></a>

```c
static uint32_t ulExampleInterruptHandler( void )
{
    BaseType_t xHigherPriorityTaskWoken;

    /* The xHigherPriorityTaskWoken parameter must be initialized to pdFALSE
       as it will get set to pdTRUE inside the interrupt safe API function if
       a context switch is required. */
    xHigherPriorityTaskWoken = pdFALSE;

    /* 'Give' the semaphore multiple times. The first will unblock the deferred
       interrupt handling task, the following 'gives' are to demonstrate that
       the semaphore latches the events to allow the task to which interrupts
       are deferred to process them in turn, without events getting lost. This
       simulates multiple interrupts being received by the processor, even
       though in this case the events are simulated within a single interrupt
       occurrence. */
    xSemaphoreGiveFromISR( xCountingSemaphore, &xHigherPriorityTaskWoken );
    xSemaphoreGiveFromISR( xCountingSemaphore, &xHigherPriorityTaskWoken );
    xSemaphoreGiveFromISR( xCountingSemaphore, &xHigherPriorityTaskWoken );

    /* Pass the xHigherPriorityTaskWoken value into portYIELD_FROM_ISR().
       If xHigherPriorityTaskWoken was set to pdTRUE inside
       xSemaphoreGiveFromISR() then calling portYIELD_FROM_ISR() will request
       a context switch. If xHigherPriorityTaskWoken is still pdFALSE then
       calling portYIELD_FROM_ISR() will have no effect. Unlike most FreeRTOS
       ports, the Windows port requires the ISR to return a value - the return
       statement is inside the Windows version of portYIELD_FROM_ISR(). */
    portYIELD_FROM_ISR( xHigherPriorityTaskWoken );
}
```
***Listing 7.13*** *The implementation of the interrupt service routine used by Example 7.2*

All the other functions remain unmodified from those used in Example 7.1.

The output produced when Example 7.2 is executed is shown in Figure 7.9.
As can be seen, the task to which interrupt handling is deferred
processes all three (simulated) events each time an interrupt is
generated. The events are latched into the count value of the semaphore,
allowing the task to process them in turn.
