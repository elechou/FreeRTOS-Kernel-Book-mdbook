## 7.4 Binary Semaphores Used for Synchronization

The interrupt safe version of the Binary Semaphore API can be used to
unblock a task each time a particular interrupt occurs, effectively
synchronizing the task with the interrupt. This allows the majority of
the interrupt event processing to be implemented within the synchronized
task, with only a very fast and short portion remaining directly in the
ISR. As described in the previous section, the binary semaphore is used
to 'defer' interrupt processing to a task[^14].

[^14]: It is more efficient to unblock a task from an interrupt using a
direct to task notification than it is using a binary semaphore.
Direct to task notifications are not covered until Chapter 10, Task
Notifications.

As previously demonstrated in Figure 7.1, if the interrupt processing is
particularly time critical, then the priority of the deferred processing
task can be set to ensure the task always pre-empts the other tasks in
the system. The ISR can then be implemented to include a call to
`portYIELD_FROM_ISR()`, ensuring the ISR returns directly to the task to
which interrupt processing is being deferred. This has the effect of
ensuring the entire event processing executes contiguously (without a
break) in time, just as if it had all been implemented within the ISR
itself. Figure 7.2 repeats the scenario shown in Figure 7.1, but with the
text updated to describe how the execution of the deferred processing
task can be controlled using a semaphore.

***Figure 7.2*** **Using a binary semaphore to implement deferred interrupt processing**
</div>

The deferred processing task uses a blocking 'take' call to a semaphore
as a means of entering the Blocked state to wait for the event to occur.
When the event occurs, the ISR uses a 'give' operation on the same
semaphore to unblock the task so that the required event processing can
proceed.

'Taking a semaphore' and 'giving a semaphore' are concepts that have
different meanings depending on their usage scenario. In this interrupt
synchronization scenario, the binary semaphore can be considered
conceptually as a queue with a length of one. The queue can contain a
maximum of one item at any time, so is always either empty or full
(hence, binary). By calling `xSemaphoreTake()`, the task to which
interrupt processing is deferred effectively attempts to read from the
queue with a block time, causing the task to enter the Blocked state if
the queue is empty. When the event occurs, the ISR uses the
`xSemaphoreGiveFromISR()` function to place a token (the semaphore) into
the queue, making the queue full. This causes the task to exit the
Blocked state and remove the token, leaving the queue empty once more.
When the task has completed its processing, it once more attempts to
read from the queue and, finding the queue empty, re-enters the Blocked
state to wait for the next event. This sequence is demonstrated in
Figure 7.3.

Figure 7.3 shows the interrupt 'giving' the semaphore, even though it has
not first 'taken' it, and the task 'taking' the semaphore, but never
giving it back. This is why the scenario is described as being
conceptually similar to writing to and reading from a queue. It often
causes confusion as it does not follow the same rules as other semaphore
usage scenarios, where a task that takes a semaphore must always give it
back—such as the scenarios described in Chapter 8, Resource Management.

### 7.4.1 The xSemaphoreCreateBinary() API Function

FreeRTOS also includes the `xSemaphoreCreateBinaryStatic()`
function, which allocates the memory required to create a binary
semaphore statically at compile time: Handles to all the various types
of FreeRTOS semaphore are stored in a variable of type
`SemaphoreHandle_t`.

Before a semaphore can be used, it must be created. To create a binary
semaphore, use the `xSemaphoreCreateBinary()` API function[^15].

[^15]: Some Semaphore API functions are actually macros, not functions.
For simplicity, they are all referred to as functions throughout
this book.


<a name="list7.3" title="Listing 7.3 The xSemaphoreCreateBinary() API function prototype"></a>

```c
SemaphoreHandle_t xSemaphoreCreateBinary( void );
```
***Listing 7.3*** *The xSemaphoreCreateBinary() API function prototype*

**xSemaphoreCreateBinary() Return Value**

- Return value

  If NULL is returned, then the semaphore cannot be created because
  there is insufficient heap memory available for FreeRTOS to allocate the
  semaphore data structures.

  If a non-NULL value is returned, it indicates that the semaphore has been
  created successfully. The returned value should be stored as the handle
  to the created semaphore.


### 7.4.2 The xSemaphoreTake() API Function

'Taking' a semaphore means to 'obtain' or 'receive' the semaphore. The
semaphore can be taken only if it is available.

All the various types of FreeRTOS semaphore, except recursive mutexes,
can be 'taken' using the `xSemaphoreTake()` function.

`xSemaphoreTake()` must not be used from an interrupt service routine.


<a name="list7.4" title="Listing 7.4 The xSemaphoreTake() API function prototype"></a>

```c
BaseType_t xSemaphoreTake( SemaphoreHandle_t xSemaphore, TickType_t xTicksToWait );
```
***Listing 7.4*** *The xSemaphoreTake() API function prototype*

**xSemaphoreTake() parameters and return value**

- `xSemaphore`

  The semaphore being 'taken'.

  A semaphore is referenced by a variable of type `SemaphoreHandle_t`. It
  must be explicitly created before it can be used.

- `xTicksToWait`

  The maximum amount of time the task should remain in the Blocked
  state to wait for the semaphore if it is not already available.

  If `xTicksToWait` is zero, then `xSemaphoreTake()` will return
  immediately if the semaphore is not available.

  The block time is specified in tick periods, so the absolute time it
  represents is dependent on the tick frequency. The macro `pdMS_TO_TICKS()`
  can be used to convert a time specified in milliseconds to a time
  specified in ticks.

  Setting `xTicksToWait` to `portMAX_DELAY` will cause the task to wait
  indefinitely (without a timeout) if `INCLUDE_vTaskSuspend` is set to 1 in
  FreeRTOSConfig.h.

- Return value

  There are two possible return values:

  - `pdPASS`

    `pdPASS` is returned only if the call to `xSemaphoreTake()` was
    successful in obtaining the semaphore.

    If a block time was specified (`xTicksToWait` was not zero), then it is
    possible that the calling task was placed into the Blocked state to wait
    for the semaphore if it was not immediately available, but the semaphore
    became available before the block time expired.

  - `pdFALSE`

    The semaphore is not available.

    If a block time was specified (`xTicksToWait` was not zero), then the
    calling task will have been placed into the Blocked state to wait for
    the semaphore to become available, but the block time expired before
    this happened.


### 7.4.3 The xSemaphoreGiveFromISR() API Function

Binary and counting semaphores[^16] can be 'given' using the
`xSemaphoreGiveFromISR()` function.

[^16]: Counting semaphores are described in a later section of this book.

`xSemaphoreGiveFromISR()` is the interrupt safe version of
`xSemaphoreGive()`, so has the `pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken` parameter that
was described at the start of this chapter.


<a name="list" title="Listing 7.5 The xSemaphoreGiveFromISR() API function prototype"></a>

```c
BaseType_t xSemaphoreGiveFromISR( SemaphoreHandle_t xSemaphore,
                                  BaseType_t *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken );
```
***Listing 7.5*** *The xSemaphoreGiveFromISR() API function prototype*

**xSemaphoreGiveFromISR() parameters and return value**

- `xSemaphore`

  The semaphore being 'given'.

  A semaphore is referenced by a variable of type `SemaphoreHandle_t`,
  and must be explicitly created before being used.

- `pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken`

  It is possible that a single semaphore will have one or more
  tasks blocked on it waiting for the semaphore to become available.
  Calling `xSemaphoreGiveFromISR()` can make the semaphore available, and so
  cause a task that was waiting for the semaphore to leave the Blocked
  state. If calling `xSemaphoreGiveFromISR()` causes a task to leave the
  Blocked state, and the unblocked task has a priority higher than the
  currently executing task (the task that was interrupted), then,
  internally, `xSemaphoreGiveFromISR()` will set `*pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken`
  to `pdTRUE`.

  If `xSemaphoreGiveFromISR()` sets this value to `pdTRUE`, then normally a
  context switch should be performed before the interrupt is exited. This
  will ensure that the interrupt returns directly to the highest priority
  Ready state task.

- Return value

  There are two possible return values:

  - `pdPASS`

    `pdPASS` will be returned only if the call to `xSemaphoreGiveFromISR()`
    is successful.

  - `pdFAIL`

    If a semaphore is already available, it cannot be given, and
    `xSemaphoreGiveFromISR()` will return `pdFAIL`.

***Example 7.1*** *Using a binary semaphore to synchronize a task with an interrupt*

---

This example uses a binary semaphore to unblock a task from an interrupt
service routine, effectively synchronizing the task with the interrupt.

A simple periodic task is used to generate a software interrupt every
500 milliseconds. A software interrupt is used for convenience because
of the complexity of hooking into a real interrupt in some target
environments. Listing 7.6 shows the implementation of the periodic task.
Note that the task prints out a string both before and after the
interrupt is generated. This allows the sequence of execution to be
observed in the output produced when the example is executed.


<a name="list7.6" title="Listing 7.6 Implementation of the task that periodically generates a software interrupt in Example 7.1"></a>

```c
/* The number of the software interrupt used in this example. The code
   shown is from the Windows project, where numbers 0 to 2 are used by the
   FreeRTOS Windows port itself, so 3 is the first number available to the
   application. */
#define mainINTERRUPT_NUMBER 3

static void vPeriodicTask( void *pvParameters )
{
    const TickType_t xDelay500ms = pdMS_TO_TICKS( 500UL );

    /* As per most tasks, this task is implemented within an infinite loop. */
    for( ;; )
    {
        /* Block until it is time to generate the software interrupt again. */
        vTaskDelay( xDelay500ms );

        /* Generate the interrupt, printing a message both before and after
           the interrupt has been generated, so the sequence of execution is
           evident from the output.

           The syntax used to generate a software interrupt is dependent on
           the FreeRTOS port being used. The syntax used below can only be
           used with the FreeRTOS Windows port, in which such interrupts are
           only simulated. */
        vPrintString( "Periodic task - About to generate an interrupt.\r\n" );
        vPortGenerateSimulatedInterrupt( mainINTERRUPT_NUMBER );
        vPrintString( "Periodic task - Interrupt generated.\r\n\r\n\r\n" );
    }
}
```
***Listing 7.6*** *Implementation of the task that periodically generates a software interrupt in Example 7.1*


Listing 7.7 shows the implementation of the task to which the interrupt
processing is deferred—the task that is synchronized with the software
interrupt through the use of a binary semaphore. Again, a string is
printed out on each iteration of the task, so the sequence in which the
task and the interrupt execute is evident from the output produced when
the example is executed.

It should be noted that, while the code shown in Listing 7.7 is adequate
for Example 7.1, where interrupts are generated by software, it is not
adequate for scenarios where interrupts are generated by hardware
peripherals. A following sub-section describes how the structure of the
code needs to be changed to make it suitable for use with hardware
generated interrupts.


<a name="list7.7." title="Listing 7.7 The implementation of the task to which the interrupt processing is deferred (the task that..."></a>

```c
static void vHandlerTask( void *pvParameters )
{
    /* As per most tasks, this task is implemented within an infinite loop. */
    for( ;; )
    {
        /* Use the semaphore to wait for the event. The semaphore was created
           before the scheduler was started, so before this task ran for the
           first time. The task blocks indefinitely, meaning this function
           call will only return once the semaphore has been successfully
           obtained - so there is no need to check the value returned by
           xSemaphoreTake(). */
        xSemaphoreTake( xBinarySemaphore, portMAX_DELAY );

        /* To get here the event must have occurred. Process the event (in
           this Case, just print out a message). */
        vPrintString( "Handler task - Processing event.\r\n" );
    }
}
```
***Listing 7.7*** *The implementation of the task to which the interrupt processing is deferred (the task that synchronizes with the interrupt) in Example 7.1*


Listing 7.8 shows the ISR. This does very little other than 'give' the
semaphore to unblock the task to which interrupt processing is deferred.

Note how the `xHigherPriorityTaskWoken` variable is used. It is set to
`pdFALSE` before calling `xSemaphoreGiveFromISR()`, then used as the
parameter when `portYIELD_FROM_ISR()` is called. A context switch will be
requested inside the `portYIELD_FROM_ISR()` macro if
`xHigherPriorityTaskWoken` equals `pdTRUE`.

The prototype of the ISR, and the macro called to force a context
switch, are both correct for the FreeRTOS Windows port, and may be
different for other FreeRTOS ports. Refer to the port specific
documentation pages on the FreeRTOS.org website, and the examples
provided in the FreeRTOS download, to find the syntax required for the
port you are using.

Unlike most architectures on which FreeRTOS runs, the FreeRTOS Windows
port requires an ISR to return a value. The implementation of the
`portYIELD_FROM_ISR()` macro provided with the Windows port includes the
return statement, so Listing 7.8 does not show a value being returned
explicitly.


<a name="list7.8" title="Listing 7.8 The ISR for the software interrupt used in Example 7.1"></a>

```c
static uint32_t ulExampleInterruptHandler( void )
{
    BaseType_t xHigherPriorityTaskWoken;

    /* The xHigherPriorityTaskWoken parameter must be initialized to
       pdFALSE as it will get set to pdTRUE inside the interrupt safe
       API function if a context switch is required. */
    xHigherPriorityTaskWoken = pdFALSE;

    /* 'Give' the semaphore to unblock the task, passing in the address of
       xHigherPriorityTaskWoken as the interrupt safe API function's
       pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken parameter. */
    xSemaphoreGiveFromISR( xBinarySemaphore, &xHigherPriorityTaskWoken );

    /* Pass the xHigherPriorityTaskWoken value into portYIELD_FROM_ISR().
       If xHigherPriorityTaskWoken was set to pdTRUE inside
       xSemaphoreGiveFromISR() then calling portYIELD_FROM_ISR() will request
       a context switch. If xHigherPriorityTaskWoken is still pdFALSE then
       calling portYIELD_FROM_ISR() will have no effect. Unlike most FreeRTOS
       ports, the Windows port requires the ISR to return a value - the return
       statement is inside the Windows version of portYIELD_FROM_ISR(). */
    portYIELD_FROM_ISR( xHigherPriorityTaskWoken );
}
```
***Listing 7.8*** *The ISR for the software interrupt used in Example 7.1*

The `main()` function creates the binary semaphore, creates the tasks,
installs the interrupt handler, and starts the scheduler. The
implementation is shown in Listing 7.9.

The syntax of the function called to install an interrupt handler is
specific to the FreeRTOS Windows port, and may be different for other
FreeRTOS ports. Refer to the port specific documentation pages on the
FreeRTOS.org website, and the examples provided in the FreeRTOS
download, to find the syntax required for the port you are using.


<a name="list7.9" title="Listing 7.9 The implementation of main() for Example 7.1"></a>

```c
int main( void )
{
    /* Before a semaphore is used it must be explicitly created. In this

    xBinarySemaphore = xSemaphoreCreateBinary();

    if( xBinarySemaphore != NULL )
    {

    for( ;; );
}
```
***Listing 7.9*** *The implementation of main() for Example 7.1*


Example 7.1 produces the output shown in Figure 7.4. As expected,
`vHandlerTask()` enters the Running state as soon as the interrupt is
generated, so the output from the task splits the output produced by the
periodic task. Further explanation is provided in Figure 7.5.

### 7.4.4 Improving the Implementation of the Task Used in Example 7.1

Example 7.1 used a binary semaphore to synchronize a task with an
interrupt. The execution sequence was as follows:

1. The interrupt occurred.

1. The ISR executed and 'gave' the semaphore to unblock the task.

1. The task executed immediately after the ISR, and 'took' the
   semaphore.

1. The task processed the event, then attempted to 'take' the semaphore
   again—entering the Blocked state because the semaphore was not yet
   available (another interrupt had not yet occurred).

The structure of the task used in Example 7.1 is adequate only if
interrupts occur at a relatively low frequency. To understand why,
consider what would happen if a second, and then a third, interrupt had
occurred before the task had completed its processing of the first
interrupt:

- When the second ISR executed, the semaphore would be empty, so the
  ISR would give the semaphore, and the task would process the second
  event immediately after it had completed processing the first event.
  That scenario is shown in Figure 7.6.

- When the third ISR executed, the semaphore would already be
  available, preventing the ISR giving the semaphore again, so the
  task would not know the third event had occurred. That scenario is
  shown in Figure 7.7.


<a name="fig7.6" title="Figure 7.6 The scenario when one interrupt occurs before the task has finished processing the first event"></a>
<a name="fig7.7" title="Figure 7.7 The scenario when two interrupts occur before the task has finished processing the first event"></a>

***Figure 7.7*** *The scenario when two interrupts occur before the task has finished processing the first event**
</div>

The deferred interrupt handling task used in Example 7.1, and shown in
Listing 7.7, is structured so that it only processes one event between
each call to `xSemaphoreTake()`. That was adequate for Example 7.1, because
the interrupts that generated the events were triggered by software, and
occurred at a predictable time. In real applications, interrupts are
generated by hardware, and occur at unpredictable times. Therefore, to
minimize the chance of an interrupt being missed, the deferred interrupt
handling task must be structured so that it processes all the events
that are already available between each call to `xSemaphoreTake()`[^17].
This is demonstrated by Listing 7.10, which shows how a deferred interrupt
handler for a UART could be structured. In Listing 7.10, it is assumed the
UART generates a receive interrupt each time a character is received,
and that the UART places received characters into a hardware FIFO (a
hardware buffer).

[^17]: Alternatively, a counting semaphore, or a direct to task
notification, can be used to count events. Counting semaphores are
described in the next section. Direct to task notifications are
described in Chapter 10, Task Notifications. Direct to task
notifications are the preferred method as they are the most
efficient in both run time and RAM usage.

The deferred interrupt handling task used in Example 7.1 had one other
weakness; it did not use a timeout when it called `xSemaphoreTake()`.
Instead, the task passed `portMAX_DELAY` as the `xSemaphoreTake()`
`xTicksToWait` parameter, which results in the task waiting indefinitely
(without a timeout) for the semaphore to be available. Indefinite
timeouts are often used in example code because their use simplifies the
structure of the example, and therefore makes the example easier to
understand. However, indefinite timeouts are normally bad practice in
real applications, because they make it difficult to recover from an
error. As an example, consider the scenario where a task is waiting for
an interrupt to give a semaphore, but an error state in the hardware is
preventing the interrupt from being generated:

- If the task is waiting without a timeout, it will not know about
  the error state, and will wait forever.

- If the task is waiting with a timeout, then `xSemaphoreTake()` will
  return `pdFAIL` when the timeout expires, and the task can then
  detect and clear the error the next time it executes. This scenario
  is also demonstrated in Listing 7.10.

               interrupts. */
