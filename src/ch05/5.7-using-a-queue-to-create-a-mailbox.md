## 5.7 Using a Queue to Create a Mailbox

There is no consensus on terminology within the embedded community, and
'mailbox' will mean different things in different RTOSes. In this book,
the term mailbox is used to refer to a queue that has a length of one. A
queue may be described as a mailbox because of the way it is used in
the application, rather than because it has a functional difference to a
queue:

- A queue is used to send data from one task to another task, or from
  an interrupt service routine to a task. The sender places an item in
  the queue, and the receiver removes the item from the queue. The
  data passes through the queue from the sender to the receiver.

- A mailbox is used to hold data that can be read by any task, or any
  interrupt service routine. The data does not pass through the
  mailbox, but instead remains in the mailbox until it is overwritten.
  The sender overwrites the value in the mailbox. The receiver reads
  the value from the mailbox, but does not remove the value from the
  mailbox.

This chapter describes two queue API functions that enable a queue to be
used as a mailbox.

Listing 5.28 shows how a queue is created for use as a mailbox.

<a name="list5.28" title="Listing 5.28 A queue being created for use as a mailbox"></a>

```c
/* A mailbox can hold a fixed size data item. The size of the data item is set
   when the mailbox (queue) is created. In this example the mailbox is created 
   to hold an Example_t structure. Example_t includes a time stamp to allow the
   data held in the mailbox to note the time at which the mailbox was last 
   updated. The time stamp used in this example is for demonstration purposes 
   only - a mailbox can hold any data the application writer wants, and the 
   data does not need to include a time stamp. */
typedef struct xExampleStructure
{
    TickType_t xTimeStamp;
    uint32_t ulValue;
} Example_t;

/* A mailbox is a queue, so its handle is stored in a variable of type
   QueueHandle_t. */
QueueHandle_t xMailbox;

void vAFunction( void )
{
    /* Create the queue that is going to be used as a mailbox. The queue has 
       a length of 1 to allow it to be used with the xQueueOverwrite() API 
       function, which is described below. */
    xMailbox = xQueueCreate( 1, sizeof( Example_t ) );
}
```

### 5.7.1 The xQueueOverwrite() API Function

Like the `xQueueSendToBack()` API function, the `xQueueOverwrite()` API
function sends data to a queue. Unlike `xQueueSendToBack()`, if the queue
is already full, then `xQueueOverwrite()` overwrites data that is already
in the queue.

`xQueueOverwrite()` must only be used with queues that have a length of
one. The overwrite mode will always write to the front of the queue and
update the front of queue pointer, but it will not update the messages
waiting.  If `configASSERT` is defined, an assert will occur if the queue
has a length &gt; 1.

> *Note: Never call `xQueueOverwrite()` from an interrupt service routine.
> The interrupt-safe version `xQueueOverwriteFromISR()` should be used in
> its place.*

<a name="list5.29" title="Listing 5.29 The xQueueOverwrite() API function prototype"></a>

```c
BaseType_t xQueueOverwrite( QueueHandle_t xQueue, const void * pvItemToQueue );
```
***Listing 5.29*** *The xQueueOverwrite() API function prototype*

**xQueueOverwrite() parameters and return value**

- `xQueue`

  The handle of the queue to which the data is being sent (written). The queue handle 
  will have been returned from the call to `xQueueCreate()` or `xQueueCreateStatic()` 
  used to create the queue.

- `pvItemToQueue`

   A pointer to the data to be copied into the queue.

   The size of each item that the queue can hold is set when the queue is
   created, so this many bytes will be copied from `pvItemToQueue` into the
   queue storage area.

- Return value

  `xQueueOverwrite()` writes to the queue even when the queue is full,
  so `pdPASS` is the only possible return value.

Listing 5.30 shows how `xQueueOverwrite()` is used to write to the mailbox
(queue) created in Listing 5.28.

<a name="list5.30" title="Listing 5.30 Using the xQueueOverwrite() API function"></a>

```c
void vUpdateMailbox( uint32_t ulNewValue )
{
    /* Example_t was defined in Listing 5.28. */
    Example_t xData;

    /* Write the new data into the Example_t structure.*/
    xData.ulValue = ulNewValue;

    /* Use the RTOS tick count as the time stamp stored in the Example_t
       structure. */
    xData.xTimeStamp = xTaskGetTickCount();

    /* Send the structure to the mailbox - overwriting any data that is 
       already in the mailbox. */
    xQueueOverwrite( xMailbox, &xData );
}
```
***Listing 5.30*** *Using the xQueueOverwrite() API function*


### 5.7.2 The xQueuePeek() API Function

`xQueuePeek()` receives (reads) an item from a queue *without* removing
the item from the queue. `xQueuePeek()` receives data from the head of the
queue without modifying the data stored in the queue, or the order in
which data is stored in the queue.

> *Note: Never call `xQueuePeek()` from an interrupt service routine. The
> interrupt-safe version `xQueuePeekFromISR()` should be used in its place.*

*`xQueuePeek()` has the same function parameters and return value as
`xQueueReceive()`.*

<a name="list5.31" title="Listing 5.31 The xQueuePeek() API function prototype"></a>

```c
BaseType_t xQueuePeek( QueueHandle_t xQueue,
                       void * const pvBuffer,
                       TickType_t xTicksToWait );
```
***Listing 5.31*** *The xQueuePeek() API function prototype*


Listing 5.32 shows `xQueuePeek()` being used to receive the item posted to
the mailbox (queue) in Listing 5.30.

<a name="list5.32" title="Listing 5.32 Using the xQueuePeek() API function"></a>

```c
BaseType_t vReadMailbox( Example_t *pxData )
{
    TickType_t xPreviousTimeStamp;
    BaseType_t xDataUpdated;

    /* This function updates an Example_t structure with the latest value
       received from the mailbox. Record the time stamp already contained in 
       *pxData before it gets overwritten by the new data. */
    xPreviousTimeStamp = pxData->xTimeStamp;

    /* Update the Example_t structure pointed to by pxData with the data
       contained in the mailbox. If xQueueReceive() was used here then the 
       mailbox would be left empty, and the data could not then be read by 
       any other tasks. Using xQueuePeek() instead of xQueueReceive() ensures 
       the data remains in the mailbox.

       A block time is specified, so the calling task will be placed in the
       Blocked state to wait for the mailbox to contain data should the mailbox
       be empty. An infinite block time is used, so it is not necessary to 
       check the value returned from xQueuePeek(), as xQueuePeek() will only 
       return when data is available. */
    xQueuePeek( xMailbox, pxData, portMAX_DELAY );

    /* Return pdTRUE if the value read from the mailbox has been updated since
       this function was last called. Otherwise return pdFALSE. */
    if( pxData->xTimeStamp > xPreviousTimeStamp )
    {
        xDataUpdated = pdTRUE;
    }
    else
    {
        xDataUpdated = pdFALSE;
    }

    return xDataUpdated;
}
```
