## 5.5 Working with Large or Variable Sized Data

### 5.5.1 Queuing Pointers

If the size of the data stored in the queue is large, then it is
preferable to use the queue to transfer pointers to the data, rather
than copy the data itself into and out of the queue byte by byte.
Transferring pointers is more efficient in both processing time and the
amount of RAM required to create the queue. However, when queuing
pointers, extreme care must be taken to ensure that:

- The owner of the RAM being pointed to is clearly defined.

  When sharing memory between tasks via a pointer, it is essential to
  ensure both tasks do not modify the memory contents simultaneously, or
  take any other action that could cause the memory contents to be invalid
  or inconsistent. Ideally, only the sending task should be permitted to
  access the memory before the pointer is sent to the queue, and only the
  receiving task should be permitted to access the memory after the
  pointer has been received from the queue.

- The RAM being pointed to remains valid.

  If the memory being pointed to was allocated dynamically, or obtained
  from a pool of pre-allocated buffers, then exactly one task should be
  responsible for freeing the memory. No tasks should attempt to access
  the memory after it has been freed.

  A pointer should never be used to access data that has been allocated on
  a task stack. The data will not be valid after the stack frame has
  changed.

By way of example, Listings 5.13, 5.14 and 5.15 demonstrate how
to use a queue to send a pointer to a buffer from one task to another:

- Listing 5.13 creates a queue that can hold up to 5 pointers.

- Listing 5.14 allocates a buffer, writes a string to the buffer, then
  sends a pointer to the buffer to the queue.

- Listing 5.15 receives a pointer to a buffer from the queue, then
  prints the string contained in the buffer.

```c
/* Declare a variable of type QueueHandle_t to hold the handle of the
   queue being created. */
QueueHandle_t xPointerQueue;

/* Create a queue that can hold a maximum of 5 pointers, in this case
   character pointers. */
xPointerQueue = xQueueCreate( 5, sizeof( char * ) );

### 5.5.2 Using a Queue to Send Different Types and Lengths of Data[^9]

[^9]: FreeRTOS message buffers are a lighter weight alternative to
queues that hold variable length data.

Previous sections of this book demonstrated two powerful design
patterns; sending structures to a queue, and sending pointers to a
queue. Combining those techniques allows a task to use a single queue to
receive any data type from any data source. The implementation of the
FreeRTOS+TCP TCP/IP stack provides a practical example of how this is
achieved.

The TCP/IP stack, which runs in its own task, must process events from
many different sources. Different event types are associated with
different types and lengths of data. `IPStackEvent_t` structures describe
all events that occur outside of the TCP/IP task, and are sent to the
TCP/IP task on a queue. Listing 5.16 shows the `IPStackEvent_t` structure.
The `pvData` member of the `IPStackEvent_t` structure is a pointer that can
be used to hold a value directly, or point to a buffer.

<a name="list5.16" title="Listing 5.16 The structure used to send events to the TCP/IP stack task in FreeRTOS+TCP"></a>

```c
/* A subset of the enumerated types used in the TCP/IP stack to
   identify events. */
typedef enum
{
    eNetworkDownEvent = 0, /* The network interface has been lost, or needs
                              (re)connecting. */
    eNetworkRxEvent,       /* A packet has been received from the network. */
    eTCPAcceptEvent,       /* FreeRTOS_accept() called to accept or wait for a
                              new client. */

/* Other event types appear here but are not shown in this listing. */

} eIPEvent_t;

/* The structure that describes events, and is sent on a queue to the
   TCP/IP task. */
typedef struct IP_TASK_COMMANDS
{
    /* An enumerated type that identifies the event. See the eIPEvent_t
       definition above. */
    eIPEvent_t eEventType;

    /* A generic pointer that can hold a value, or point to a buffer. */
    void *pvData;

} IPStackEvent_t;
```
***Listing 5.16*** *The structure used to send events to the TCP/IP stack task in FreeRTOS+TCP*

Example TCP/IP events, and their associated data, include:

- `eNetworkRxEvent`: A packet of data was received from the network.

  The network interface sends data received events to the TCP/IP task
  using a structure of type `IPStackEvent_t`. The structure's `eEventType`
  member is set to `eNetworkRxEvent`, and the structure's `pvData` member is
  used to point to the buffer that contains the received data. Listing
  59 shows a pseudo code example.

  <a name="list5.17" title="Listing 5.17 Pseudo code showing how an IPStackEvent_t structure is used to send data received from the network to the TCP/IP task"></a>

  ```c
  void vSendRxDataToTheTCPTask( NetworkBufferDescriptor_t *pxRxedData )
  {
      IPStackEvent_t xEventStruct;
  
      /* Complete the IPStackEvent_t structure. The received data is stored in
         pxRxedData. */
      xEventStruct.eEventType = eNetworkRxEvent;
      xEventStruct.pvData = ( void * ) pxRxedData;
  
      /* Send the IPStackEvent_t structure to the TCP/IP task. */
      xSendEventStructToIPTask( &xEventStruct );
  }
  ```
  ***Listing 5.17*** *Pseudo code showing how an IPStackEvent_t structure is used to send data received from the network to the TCP/IP task*

- `eTCPAcceptEvent`: A socket is to accept, or wait for, a connection
  from a client.

  The task that called `FreeRTOS_accept()` sends accept events to the
  TCP/IP task using a structure of type `IPStackEvent_t`. The structure's
  `eEventType` member is set to `eTCPAcceptEvent`, and the structure's
  `pvData` member is set to the handle of the socket that is accepting a
  connection. Listing 5.18 shows a pseudo code example.

  <a name="list5.18" title="Listing 5.18 Pseudo code showing how an IPStackEvent_t structure is used to send the handle of a socket that is accepting a connection to the TCP/IP task"></a>

  ```c
  void vSendAcceptRequestToTheTCPTask( Socket_t xSocket )
  {
      IPStackEvent_t xEventStruct;

      /* Complete the IPStackEvent_t structure. */
      xEventStruct.eEventType = eTCPAcceptEvent;
      xEventStruct.pvData = ( void * ) xSocket;

      /* Send the IPStackEvent_t structure to the TCP/IP task. */
      xSendEventStructToIPTask( &xEventStruct );
  }
  ```
  ***Listing 5.18*** *Pseudo code showing how an IPStackEvent_t structure is used to send the handle of a socket that is accepting a connection to the TCP/IP task*
  
- `eNetworkDownEvent`: The network needs connecting, or re-connecting.

  The network interface sends network down events to the TCP/IP task
  using a structure of type `IPStackEvent_t`. The structure's `eEventType`
  member is set to `eNetworkDownEvent`. Network down events are not
  associated with any data, so the structure's `pvData` member is not
  used. Listing 5.19 shows a pseudo code example.

  <a name="list5.19" title="Listing 5.19 Pseudo code showing how an IPStackEvent_t structure is used to send a network down event to the TCP/IP task"></a>

  ```c
  void vSendNetworkDownEventToTheTCPTask( Socket_t xSocket )
  {
      IPStackEvent_t xEventStruct;

      /* Complete the IPStackEvent_t structure. */
      xEventStruct.eEventType = eNetworkDownEvent;

      xEventStruct.pvData = NULL; /* Not used, but set to NULL for
                                     completeness. */

      /* Send the IPStackEvent_t structure to the TCP/IP task. */
      xSendEventStructToIPTask( &xEventStruct );
  }
  ```
  ***Listing 5.19*** *Pseudo code showing how an IPStackEvent_t structure is used to send a network down event to the TCP/IP task*
  
  Listing 5.20 shows the code that receives and processes these events
  within the TCP/IP task. It can be seen that the `eEventType` member of the
  `IPStackEvent_t` structures received from the queue is used to determine
  how the `pvData` member is to be interpreted.

  <a name="list5.20" title="Listing 5.20 Pseudo code showing how an IPStackEvent_t structure is received and processed"></a>

  ```c
  IPStackEvent_t xReceivedEvent;

  /* Block on the network event queue until either an event is received, or 
     xNextIPSleep ticks pass without an event being received. eEventType is 
     set to eNoEvent in case the call to xQueueReceive() returns because it 
     timed out, rather than because an event was received. */
  xReceivedEvent.eEventType = eNoEvent;
  xQueueReceive( xNetworkEventQueue, &xReceivedEvent, xNextIPSleep );

  /* Which event was received, if any? */
  switch( xReceivedEvent.eEventType )
  {
      case eNetworkDownEvent :
           /* Attempt to (re)establish a connection. This event is not 
              associated with any data. */
           prvProcessNetworkDownEvent();
           break;

      case eNetworkRxEvent:
           /* The network interface has received a new packet. A pointer to the
              received data is stored in the pvData member of the received 
              IPStackEvent_t structure. Process the received data. */
           prvHandleEthernetPacket( ( NetworkBufferDescriptor_t * )
                                    ( xReceivedEvent.pvData ) );
           break;

      case eTCPAcceptEvent:
           /* The FreeRTOS_accept() API function was called. The handle of the
              socket that is accepting a connection is stored in the pvData 
              member of the received IPStackEvent_t structure. */
           xSocket = ( FreeRTOS_Socket_t * ) ( xReceivedEvent.pvData );
           xTCPCheckNewClient( xSocket );
           break;

      /* Other event types are processed in the same way, but are not shown
         here. */

  }
