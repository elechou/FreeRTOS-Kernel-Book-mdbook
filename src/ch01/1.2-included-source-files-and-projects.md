## 1.2 Included Source Files and Projects

### 1.2.1 Obtaining the Examples that Accompany this Book

The zip file available for download from <https://www.FreeRTOS.org/Documentation/code>
contains all the source code, pre-configured project files, and
instructions necessary to build and execute the examples presented in
this book. Note the zip file will not necessarily contain the most
recent version of FreeRTOS.

The screenshots included in this book show the examples executing in a
Microsoft Windows environment, using the FreeRTOS Windows port. The
project that uses the FreeRTOS Windows port is pre-configured to build
using the free Community edition of Visual Studio, available from
<https://www.visualstudio.com/>. Note that while the FreeRTOS Windows
port provides a convenient evaluation, test, and development platform,
it does *not* provide true real-time behavior.
