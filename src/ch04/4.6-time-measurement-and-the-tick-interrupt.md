## 4.6 Time Measurement and the Tick Interrupt

[Section 4.12, Scheduling Algorithms](#412-scheduling-algorithms), describes an
optional feature called 'time slicing'. Time slicing was used in the examples
presented so far, and is the behavior observed in the output they produced.
In the examples, both tasks were created at the same priority, and both
tasks were always able to run. Therefore, each task executed for a 'time
slice', entering the *Running* state at the start of a time slice, and
exiting the *Running* state at the end of a time slice. In Figure 4.3, the
time between t1 and t2 equals a single time slice.

The scheduler executes at the end of each time slice to select the next
task to run[^5]. A periodic interrupt, called the 'tick interrupt', is
used for this purpose. The `configTICK_RATE_HZ` compile-time configuration
constant sets the frequency of the tick interrupt, and so also the
length of each time slice. For example, setting `configTICK_RATE_HZ` to
100 (Hz) results in each time slice lasting 10 milliseconds. The time
between two tick interrupts is called the 'tick period'—so one time
slice equals one tick period.

[^5]: It is important to note that the end of a time slice is not the
only place that the scheduler can select a new task to run. As we will
demonstrate throughout this book, the scheduler will also select
a new task to run immediately after the currently executing task
enters the *Blocked* state, or when an interrupt moves a higher
priority task into the *Ready* state.

Figure 4.4 expands on Figure 4.3 to also show the execution of the
scheduler. In Figure 4.4, the top line shows when the scheduler is
executing, and the thin arrows show the sequence of execution from a
task to the tick interrupt, then from the tick interrupt back to a
different task.

The optimal value for `configTICK_RATE_HZ` depends on the application,
although a value of 100 is typical.

FreeRTOS API calls specify time in multiples of tick periods, often
referred to simply as 'ticks'. The `pdMS_TO_TICKS()` macro converts a time
specified in milliseconds into a time specified in ticks. The resolution
available depends on the defined tick frequency, and `pdMS_TO_TICKS()`
cannot be used if the tick frequency is above 1KHz (if
`configTICK_RATE_HZ` is greater than 1000). Listing 4.10 shows how to use
`pdMS_TO_TICKS()` to convert a time specified as 200 milliseconds into an
equivalent time specified in ticks.


<a name="list4.10" title="Listing 4.10 Using the pdMS\_TO\_TICKS() macro to convert 200 milliseconds..."></a>

```c
/*
 * pdMS_TO_TICKS() takes a time in milliseconds as its only parameter,
 * and evaluates to the equivalent time in tick periods. This example shows
 * xTimeInTicks being set to the number of tick periods that are equivalent
 * to 200 milliseconds.
 */
TickType_t xTimeInTicks = pdMS_TO_TICKS( 200 );
```

***Listing 4.10*** *Using the pdMS\_TO\_TICKS() macro to convert 200 milliseconds
into an equivalent time in tick periods*

Using `pdMS_TO_TICKS()` to specify times in milliseconds, rather than
directly as ticks, ensures times specified within the application do not
change if the tick frequency is changed.

The 'tick count' is the total number of tick interrupts that have
occurred since the scheduler started, assuming the tick count has not
overflowed. User applications do not have to consider overflows when
specifying delay periods, as FreeRTOS manages time consistency
internally.

[Section 4.12: Scheduling Algorithms](#412-scheduling-algorithms)
describes configuration constants which affect when the scheduler will
select a new task to run and when a tick interrupt will execute.

***Example 4.3*** *Experimenting with priorities*

The scheduler will always ensure the highest priority task that can run
is the task selected to enter the *Running* state. The examples so far
created two tasks at the same priority, so both entered and exited the
*Running* state in turn. This example looks at what happens when the tasks
have different priorities. Listing 4.11 shows the code used to create the
tasks, the first with priority 1, and the second with priority 2. The
single function that implements both tasks has not changed; it still
periodically prints a string, using a null loop to create a delay.

```c
/*
 * Define the strings that will be passed in as the task parameters.
 * These are defined const and not on the stack to ensure they remain valid
 * when the tasks are executing.
 */
static const char * pcTextForTask1 = "Task 1 is running";
static const char * pcTextForTask2 = "Task 2 is running";

int main( void )
{
    /* Create the first task with a priority of 1. */
    xTaskCreate( vTaskFunction,             /* Task Function    */
                 "Task 1",                  /* Task Name        */
                 1000,                      /* Task Stack Depth */
                 ( void * ) pcTextForTask1, /* Task Parameter   */
                 1,                         /* Task Priority    */
                 NULL );

    /* Create the second task at a higher priority of 2. */
    xTaskCreate( vTaskFunction,             /* Task Function    */
                 "Task 2",                  /* Task Name        */
                 1000,                      /* Task Stack Depth */
                 ( void * ) pcTextForTask2, /* Task Parameter   */
                 2,                         /* Task Priority    */
                 NULL );

    /* Start the scheduler so the tasks start executing. */
    vTaskStartScheduler();

    /* Will not reach here. */
    return 0;
}
```

***Listing 4.11*** *Creating two tasks at different priorities*

Figure 4.5 shows the output produced by Example 4.3.

The scheduler will always select the highest priority task that can run.
Task 2 has a higher priority than Task 1 and can always run; therefore,
the scheduler always selects Task 2, and Task 1 never executes. Task 1
is said to be 'starved' of processing time by Task 2—it can't print its
string because it is never in the *Running* state.

Task 2 can always run because it never has to wait for anything—it is
either cycling around a null loop or printing to the terminal.
