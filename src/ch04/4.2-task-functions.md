## 4.2 Task Functions

Tasks are implemented as C functions. Tasks must implement the expected function
prototype shown in Listing 4.1. which takes a void pointer parameter and returns
void.

<a name="list4.1" title="Listing 4.1 The task function prototype"></a>

```c
void vATaskFunction( void * pvParameters );
```

***Listing 4.1*** *The task function prototype*


Each task is a small program in its own right. It has an entry point,
will normally run forever in an infinite loop, and does not exit.
Listing 4.2 shows the structure of a typical task.

A FreeRTOS task must not be allowed to return from the function that implements
it in any way. It must not contain a 'return' statement and must
not be allowed to execute past the end of its implementing function.
If a task is no longer required, it should be explicitly deleted as
demonstrated in Listing 4.2.

A single task function definition can be used to create any number of
tasks where each created task is a separate execution instance. Each instance has
its own stack and thus its own copy of any automatic (stack) variables defined
within the task itself.

```c
void vATaskFunction( void * pvParameters )
{
    /*
     * Stack-allocated variables can be declared normally when inside a function.
     * Each instance of a task created using this example function will have its
     * own separate instance of lStackVariable allocated on the task's stack.
     */
    long lStackVariable = 0;

    /*
     * In contrast to stack allocated variables, variables declared with the `static`
     * keyword are allocated to a specific location in memory by the linker.
     * This means that all tasks calling vATaskFunction will share the same
     * instance of lStaticVariable.
     */
    static long lStaticVariable = 0;

    for( ;; )
    {
        /* The code to implement the task functionality will go here. */
    }

    /*
     * If the task implementation ever exits the above loop, then the task
     * must be deleted before reaching the end of its implementing function.
     * When NULL is passed as a parameter to the vTaskDelete() API function,
     * this indicates that the task to be deleted is the calling (this) task.
     */
    vTaskDelete( NULL );
}
```
