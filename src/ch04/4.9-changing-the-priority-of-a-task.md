## 4.9 Changing the Priority of a Task

### 4.9.1 The vTaskPrioritySet() API Function

The `vTaskPrioritySet()` API function changes the priority of a task after
the scheduler has been started. The `vTaskPrioritySet()` API function is
only available when `INCLUDE_vTaskPrioritySet` is set to 1 in
FreeRTOSConfig.h.


<a name="list4.21" title="Listing 4.21 The vTaskPrioritySet() API function prototype"></a>

```c
void vTaskPrioritySet( TaskHandle_t xTask,
                       UBaseType_t uxNewPriority );
```

***Listing 4.21*** *The vTaskPrioritySet() API function prototype*

**vTaskPrioritySet() parameters**

- `pxTask`

  The handle of the task whose priority is being modified (the
  subject task). See the `pxCreatedTask` parameter of the `xTaskCreate()` API
  function, or the return value of the `xTaskCreateStatic()` API function,
  for information on obtaining handles to tasks.

  A task can change its own priority by passing NULL in place of a
  valid task handle.

- `uxNewPriority`

  The priority to which the subject task is to be set. This is capped
  automatically to the maximum available priority of `(configMAX_PRIORITIES – 1)`,
  where `configMAX_PRIORITIES` is a compile time constant set in the
  FreeRTOSConfig.h header file.


### 4.9.2 The uxTaskPriorityGet() API Function

The `uxTaskPriorityGet()` API function returns the priority of a task. The
`uxTaskPriorityGet()` API function is only available when
`INCLUDE_uxTaskPriorityGet` is set to 1 in FreeRTOSConfig.h.


<a name="list4.22" title="Listing 4.22 The uxTaskPriorityGet() API function prototype"></a>

```c
UBaseType_t uxTaskPriorityGet( TaskHandle_t xTask );
```

***Listing 4.22*** *The uxTaskPriorityGet() API function prototype*

**uxTaskPriorityGet() parameters and return value**

- `pxTask`

  The handle of the task whose priority is being queried (the
  subject task). See the `pxCreatedTask` parameter of the `xTaskCreate()` API
  function, or the return value of the `xTaskCreateStatic()` API function,
  for information on how to obtain handles to tasks.

  A task can query its own priority by passing NULL in place of a valid
  task handle.

- Return value

  The priority currently assigned to the task being queried.

***Example 4.8*** *Changing task priorities*

---

The scheduler always selects the highest *Ready* state task as the task to
enter the *Running* state. Example 4.8 demonstrates this by using the
`vTaskPrioritySet()` API function to change the priority of two tasks
relative to each other.

Example 4.8 creates two tasks at two different priorities. Neither task
makes any API function calls that could cause it to enter the Blocked
state, so both are always in either the *Ready* state or the Running
state. Therefore, the task with the highest relative priority will
always be the task selected by the scheduler to be in the *Running* state.

Example 4.8 behaves as follows:

1. Task 1 (Listing 4.23) is created with the highest priority, so it is
   guaranteed to run first. Task 1 prints out a couple of strings
   before raising the priority of Task 2 (Listing 4.24) above its own
   priority.

1. Task 2 starts to run (enters the *Running* state) as soon as it has
   the highest relative priority. Only one task can be in the Running
   state at any one time, so when Task 2 is in the *Running* state, Task
   1 is in the *Ready* state.

1. Task 2 prints out a message before setting its own priority back
   down to below that of Task 1.

1. When Task 2 sets its priority back down, then Task 1 is once again the
   highest priority task, so Task 1 re-enters the *Running* state,
   forcing Task 2 back into the *Ready* state.


<a name="list4.23" title="Listing 4.23 The implementation of Task 1 in Example 4.8"></a>

```c
void vTask1( void * pvParameters )
{
    UBaseType_t uxPriority;

    /*
     * This task will always run before Task 2 as it is created with the higher
     * priority. Neither Task 1 nor Task 2 ever block so both will always be in
     * either the Running or the Ready state.
     */

    /*
     * Query the priority at which this task is running - passing in NULL means
     * "return the calling task's priority".
     */
    uxPriority = uxTaskPriorityGet( NULL );

    for( ;; )
    {
        /* Print out the name of this task. */
        vPrintLine( "Task 1 is running" );

        /*
         * Setting the Task 2 priority above the Task 1 priority will cause
         * Task 2 to immediately start running (as then Task 2 will have the
         * higher priority of the two created tasks). Note the use of the
         * handle to task 2 (xTask2Handle) in the call to vTaskPrioritySet().
         * Listing 4.25 shows how the handle was obtained.
         */
        vPrintLine( "About to raise the Task 2 priority" );
        vTaskPrioritySet( xTask2Handle, ( uxPriority + 1 ) );

        /*
         * Task 1 will only run when it has a priority higher than Task 2.
         * Therefore, for this task to reach this point, Task 2 must already
         * have executed and set its priority back down to below the priority
         * of this task.
         */
    }
}
```

    uxPriority = uxTaskPriorityGet( NULL );

    for( ;; )
    {
        /*

         /* Print out the name of this task. */
        vPrintLine( "Task 2 is running" );

        /*
         * Set the priority of this task back down to its original value.
         * Passing in NULL as the task handle means "change the priority of the
         * calling task". Setting the priority below that of Task 1 will cause
         * Task 1 to immediately start running again – preempting this task.
         */
        vPrintLine( "About to lower the Task 2 priority" );
        vTaskPrioritySet( NULL, ( uxPriority - 2 ) );
    }
}
```

***Listing 4.24*** *The implementation of Task 2 in Example 4.8*

Each task can both query and set its own priority by using NULL in place
of a valid task handle. A task handle is only required when a task
wishes to reference a task other than itself, such as when Task 1
changes the priority of Task 2. To allow Task 1 to do this, the Task 2
handle is obtained and saved when Task 2 is created, as highlighted in
the comments in Listing 4.25.


<a name="list4.25" title="Listing 4.25 The implementation of main() for Example 4.8"></a>

```c
/* Declare a variable that is used to hold the handle of Task 2. */
TaskHandle_t xTask2Handle = NULL;

int main( void )
{
    /*
     * Create the first task at priority 2. The task parameter is not used
     * and set to NULL. The task handle is also not used so is also set to
     * NULL.
     */
    xTaskCreate( vTask1, "Task 1", 1000, NULL, 2, NULL );
    /* The task is created at priority 2 ______^. */

    /*
     * Create the second task at priority 1 - which is lower than the priority
     * given to Task 1. Again the task parameter is not used so is set to NULL-
     * BUT this time the task handle is required so the address of xTask2Handle
     * is passed in the last parameter.
     */
    xTaskCreate( vTask2, "Task 2", 1000, NULL, 1, &xTask2Handle );
    /* The task handle is the last parameter _____^^^^^^^^^^^^^ */

    /* Start the scheduler so the tasks start executing. */
    vTaskStartScheduler();

    /*
     * If all is well main() will not reach here because the scheduler will
     * now be running the created tasks. If main() does reach here then there
     * was not enough heap memory to create either the idle or timer tasks
     * (described later in this book). Chapter 2 provides more information on
     * heap memory management.
     */
    for( ;; )
