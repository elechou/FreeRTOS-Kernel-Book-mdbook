## 4.10 Deleting a Task

### 4.10.1 The vTaskDelete() API Function

The `vTaskDelete()` API function deletes a task. The `vTaskDelete()` API
function is only available when `INCLUDE_vTaskDelete` is set to 1 in
FreeRTOSConfig.h.

It is not good practice to continuously create and delete tasks at run
time, so consider other design options, such as re-using tasks, if you
find yourself needing this function.

Deleted tasks no longer exist and cannot enter the *Running* state again.

If a task that was created using dynamic memory allocation later deletes itself,
the Idle task is responsible for freeing the memory allocated for use, such as
the deleted task's data structure and stack. So it is important that
applications do not completely starve the Idle task of all processing
time when this is the case.

> *Note: Only memory allocated to a task by the kernel itself is freed
> automatically when the task is deleted. Any memory or other resource
> that was allocated during the implementation of the task must be freed explicitly
> if it is no longer needed.*

```c
void vTaskDelete( TaskHandle_t xTaskToDelete );
```

***Listing 4.26*** *The vTaskDelete() API function prototype*

**vTaskDelete() parameters**

- `pxTaskToDelete`

  The handle of the task that is to be deleted (the subject
  task). See the `pxCreatedTask` parameter of the `xTaskCreate()` API function,
  and the return value of the `xTaskCreateStatic()` API function, for
  information on obtaining handles to tasks.

  A task can delete itself by passing NULL in place of a valid task
  handle.

***Example 4.9*** *Deleting tasks*

---

This is a very simple example that behaves as follows.

1. Task 1 is created by `main()` with priority 1. When it runs, it
   creates Task 2 at priority 2. Task 2 is now the highest priority
   task, so it starts to execute immediately. Listing 4.27 shows the
   source code for `main()`. Listing 4.28 shows the source code for Task 1.

1. Task 2 does nothing other than delete itself. It could delete itself
   by passing NULL to `vTaskDelete()` but instead, for demonstration
   purposes, it uses its own task handle. Listing 4.29 shows the source
   code for Task 2.

1. When Task 2 has been deleted, Task 1 is again the highest priority
   task, so it continues executingâ€”at which point it calls `vTaskDelay()` to
   block for a short period.

1. The Idle task executes while Task 1 is in the blocked state and
   frees the memory that was allocated to the now deleted Task 2.

1. When Task 1 leaves the blocked state it again becomes the highest
   priority *Ready* state task and so preempts the Idle task. When it
   enters the *Running* state it creates Task 2 again, and so it goes on.

```c
int main( void )
{
    /* Create the first task at priority 1. */
    xTaskCreate( vTask1, "Task 1", 1000, NULL, 1, NULL );

    /* Start the scheduler so the task starts executing. */
    vTaskStartScheduler();

    /* main() should never reach here as the scheduler has been started. */
    for( ;; )
    {
    }
}
```

         */
        xTaskCreate( vTask2, "Task 2", 1000, NULL, 2, &xTask2Handle );

        /*
         * Task 2 has/had the higher priority. For Task 1 to reach here, Task 2
         * must have already executed and deleted itself.
         */
        vTaskDelay( xDelay100ms );
    }
