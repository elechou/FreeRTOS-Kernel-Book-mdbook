<p>It is common in FreeRTOS designs for a task to receive data from more
than one source. The receiving task needs to know where the data came
from to determine what to do with it. An easy design pattern to achieve
that uses a single queue to transfer structures that contain both the
data value and data source, as demonstrated in Figure 5.4.</p>
<p><a name="fig5.4" title="Figure 5.4 An example scenario where structures are sent on a queue"></a></p>
<div align="center">
<img src="../media/image34.png" alt="Figure 5.4 *An example scenario where structures are sent on a queue*"/>
<p><em><strong>Figure 5.4</strong></em> <strong>An example scenario where structures are sent on a queue</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Referring to Figure 5.4:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The created queue holds structures of type <code>Data_t</code>. The structure
allows both a data value and an enumerated type indicating what the
data means to be sent to the queue in one message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A central Controller task performs the primary system function. This
has to react to inputs and changes to the system state communicated
to it on the queue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A CAN bus task is used to encapsulate the CAN bus interfacing
functionality. When the CAN bus task has received and decoded a
message, it sends the already decoded message to the Controller task
in a <code>Data_t</code> structure. The <code>eDataID</code> member of the transferred
structure tells the Controller task what the data is. In the case
shown here, it is a motor speed value. The <code>lDataValue</code> member of the
transferred structure tells the Controller task the actual motor
speed value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Human Machine Interface (HMI) task is used to encapsulate all the
HMI functionality. The machine operator can probably input commands
and query values in a number of ways that have to be detected and
interpreted within the HMI task. When a new command is input, the
HMI task sends the command to the Controller task in a <code>Data_t</code>
structure. The <code>eDataID</code> member of the transferred structure tells the
Controller task what the data is. In the case shown here, it is a new
set point value. The <code>lDataValue</code> member of the transferred structure
tells the Controller task the actual set point value.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Chapter (RB-TBD) shows how to extend this design pattern such that
the controller task can reply directly to the task that queued a structure.</p>
<h2 id=""><a class="header" href="#"><a name="example5.2" title="Example 5.2 Blocking when sending to a queue, and sending structures on a queue"></a></a></h2>
<p><em><strong>Example 5.2</strong></em> <em>Blocking when sending to a queue, and sending structures on a queue</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Example 5.2 is similar to Example 5.1, but with reversed task priorities,
so the receiving task has a lower priority than the sending tasks. Also,
the created queue holds structures rather than integers.</p>
<p>Listing 5.9 shows the definition of the structure used by Example 5.2.</p>
<p><a name="list5.9" title="Listing 5.9 The definition of the structure that is to be passed on a queue, plus the declaration of two variables for use by the example"></a></p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/* Define an enumerated type used to identify the source of the data. */
typedef enum
{
    eSender1,
    eSender2
} DataSource_t;

/* Define the structure type that will be passed on the queue. */
typedef struct
{
    uint8_t ucValue;
    DataSource_t eDataSource;
} Data_t;

/* Declare two variables of type Data_t that will be passed on the queue. */
static const Data_t xStructsToSend[ 2 ] =

    { 100, eSender1 }, /* Used by Sender1. */

};
</code></pre>
<p><em><strong>Listing 5.9</strong></em> <em>The definition of the structure that is to be passed on a queue, plus the declaration of two variables for use by the example</em></p>
<p>In Example 5.1, the receiving task has the highest priority, so the queue
never contains more than one item. This happens because the receiving task
pre-empts the sending tasks as soon as data is placed into the queue.
In Example 5.2, the sending tasks have the higher priority, so the queue
will normally be full. This is because, as soon as the receiving task
removes an item from the queue, it is pre-empted by one of the sending
tasks which then immediately re-fills the queue. The sending task then
re-enters the Blocked state to wait for space to become available on the
queue again.</p>
<p>Listing 5.10 shows the implementation of the sending task. The sending
task specifies a block time of 100 milliseconds, so it enters the
Blocked state to wait for space to become available each time the queue
becomes full. It leaves the Blocked state when either space is available
on the queue, or 100 milliseconds passes without space becoming
available. In this example, the receiving tasks continuously make space
in the queue, so the 100 milliseconds timeout never expires.</p>

           because the sending tasks have a higher priority than the receiving 
           task so the queue is expected to become full. The receiving task

<p>Figure 5.6 demonstrates the sequence of execution that results from
having the priority of the sending tasks above the priority of the
receiving task. Given below is a further explanation of Figure 5.6, and
description on why the first four messages originate from the same task.</p>

<p><strong>Key to Figure 5.6</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>t1</p>
<p>Task Sender 1 executes and sends 3 data items to the queue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>t2</p>
<p>The queue is full so Sender 1 enters the Blocked state to wait for
its next send to complete. Task Sender 2 is now the highest priority
task that can run, so it enters the Running state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>t3</p>
<p>Task Sender 2 finds the queue is already full, so it enters the Blocked
state to wait for its first send to complete. Task Receiver is now the
highest priority task that can run, so it enters the Running state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>t4</p>
<p>Two tasks that have a priority higher than the receiving task's
priority are waiting for space to become available on the queue,
resulting in task Receiver being pre-empted as soon as it has removed
one item from the queue. Tasks Sender 1 and Sender 2 have the same
priority, so the scheduler selects the task that has been waiting the
longest as the task that will enter the Running state—in this case that
is task Sender 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>t5</p>
<p>Task Sender 1 sends another data item to the queue. There was
only one space in the queue, so task Sender 1 enters the Blocked state
to wait for its next send to complete. Task Receiver is again the
highest priority task that can run so it enters the Running state.</p>
<p>Task Sender 1 has now sent four items to the queue, and task Sender 2
is still waiting to send its first item to the queue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>t6</p>
<p>Two tasks that have a priority higher than the receiving task's
priority are waiting for space to become available on the queue, so task
Receiver is pre-empted as soon as it has removed one item from the
queue. This time Sender 2 has been waiting longer than Sender 1, so
Sender 2 enters the Running state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>t7</p>
<p>Task Sender 2 sends a data item to the queue. There was only one
space in the queue so Sender 2 enters the Blocked state to wait for its
next send to complete. Both tasks Sender 1 and Sender 2 are waiting for
space to become available on the queue, so task Receiver is the only
task that can enter the Running state.</p>
</li>
</ul>
