<p>The interrupt safe version of the Binary Semaphore API can be used to
unblock a task each time a particular interrupt occurs, effectively
synchronizing the task with the interrupt. This allows the majority of
the interrupt event processing to be implemented within the synchronized
task, with only a very fast and short portion remaining directly in the
ISR. As described in the previous section, the binary semaphore is used
to 'defer' interrupt processing to a task<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-14-1"><a href="#footnote-14">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>As previously demonstrated in Figure 7.1, if the interrupt processing is
particularly time critical, then the priority of the deferred processing
task can be set to ensure the task always pre-empts the other tasks in
the system. The ISR can then be implemented to include a call to
<code>portYIELD_FROM_ISR()</code>, ensuring the ISR returns directly to the task to
which interrupt processing is being deferred. This has the effect of
ensuring the entire event processing executes contiguously (without a
break) in time, just as if it had all been implemented within the ISR
itself. Figure 7.2 repeats the scenario shown in Figure 7.1, but with the
text updated to describe how the execution of the deferred processing
task can be controlled using a semaphore.</p>
<p><a name="fig7.2" title="Figure 7.2 Using a binary semaphore to implement deferred interrupt processing"></a></p>
<div align="center">
<img src="../media/image49.png" alt="Figure 7.2 *Using a binary semaphore to implement deferred interrupt processing*"/>
<p><em><strong>Figure 7.2</strong></em> <strong>Using a binary semaphore to implement deferred interrupt processing</strong></p>
</div>
<p>The deferred processing task uses a blocking 'take' call to a semaphore
as a means of entering the Blocked state to wait for the event to occur.
When the event occurs, the ISR uses a 'give' operation on the same
semaphore to unblock the task so that the required event processing can
proceed.</p>
<p>'Taking a semaphore' and 'giving a semaphore' are concepts that have
different meanings depending on their usage scenario. In this interrupt
synchronization scenario, the binary semaphore can be considered
conceptually as a queue with a length of one. The queue can contain a
maximum of one item at any time, so is always either empty or full
(hence, binary). By calling <code>xSemaphoreTake()</code>, the task to which
interrupt processing is deferred effectively attempts to read from the
queue with a block time, causing the task to enter the Blocked state if
the queue is empty. When the event occurs, the ISR uses the
<code>xSemaphoreGiveFromISR()</code> function to place a token (the semaphore) into
the queue, making the queue full. This causes the task to exit the
Blocked state and remove the token, leaving the queue empty once more.
When the task has completed its processing, it once more attempts to
read from the queue and, finding the queue empty, re-enters the Blocked
state to wait for the next event. This sequence is demonstrated in
Figure 7.3.</p>
<p>Figure 7.3 shows the interrupt 'giving' the semaphore, even though it has
not first 'taken' it, and the task 'taking' the semaphore, but never
giving it back. This is why the scenario is described as being
conceptually similar to writing to and reading from a queue. It often
causes confusion as it does not follow the same rules as other semaphore
usage scenarios, where a task that takes a semaphore must always give it
back—such as the scenarios described in Chapter 8, Resource Management.</p>

<p>The maximum amount of time the task should remain in the Blocked

<p>The block time is specified in tick periods, so the absolute time it

can be used to convert a time specified in milliseconds to a time
specified in ticks.</p>

<li>
<p><code>pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken</code></p>
<p>It is possible that a single semaphore will have one or more
tasks blocked on it waiting for the semaphore to become available.
Calling <code>xSemaphoreGiveFromISR()</code> can make the semaphore available, and so
cause a task that was waiting for the semaphore to leave the Blocked
state. If calling <code>xSemaphoreGiveFromISR()</code> causes a task to leave the
Blocked state, and the unblocked task has a priority higher than the
currently executing task (the task that was interrupted), then,
internally, <code>xSemaphoreGiveFromISR()</code> will set <code>*pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken</code>
to <code>pdTRUE</code>.</p>
<p>If <code>xSemaphoreGiveFromISR()</code> sets this value to <code>pdTRUE</code>, then normally a
context switch should be performed before the interrupt is exited. This
will ensure that the interrupt returns directly to the highest priority
Ready state task.</p>

<p><em><strong>Example 7.1</strong></em> <em>Using a binary semaphore to synchronize a task with an interrupt</em></p>
<hr />
<p>This example uses a binary semaphore to unblock a task from an interrupt
service routine, effectively synchronizing the task with the interrupt.</p>
<p>A simple periodic task is used to generate a software interrupt every
500 milliseconds. A software interrupt is used for convenience because
of the complexity of hooking into a real interrupt in some target
environments. Listing 7.6 shows the implementation of the periodic task.
Note that the task prints out a string both before and after the
interrupt is generated. This allows the sequence of execution to be
observed in the output produced when the example is executed.</p>

<p><em><strong>Listing 7.6</strong></em> <em>Implementation of the task that periodically generates a software interrupt in Example 7.1</em></p>
<p>Listing 7.7 shows the implementation of the task to which the interrupt
processing is deferred—the task that is synchronized with the software
interrupt through the use of a binary semaphore. Again, a string is
printed out on each iteration of the task, so the sequence in which the
task and the interrupt execute is evident from the output produced when
the example is executed.</p>
<p>It should be noted that, while the code shown in Listing 7.7 is adequate
for Example 7.1, where interrupts are generated by software, it is not
adequate for scenarios where interrupts are generated by hardware
peripherals. A following sub-section describes how the structure of the
code needs to be changed to make it suitable for use with hardware
generated interrupts.</p>

<p>The prototype of the ISR, and the macro called to force a context

<p>Unlike most architectures on which FreeRTOS runs, the FreeRTOS Windows

return statement, so Listing 7.8 does not show a value being returned
explicitly.</p>

<p>Example 7.1 produces the output shown in Figure 7.4. As expected,

<p>Example 7.1 used a binary semaphore to synchronize a task with an
interrupt. The execution sequence was as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The interrupt occurred.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ISR executed and 'gave' the semaphore to unblock the task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The task executed immediately after the ISR, and 'took' the
semaphore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The task processed the event, then attempted to 'take' the semaphore
again—entering the Blocked state because the semaphore was not yet
available (another interrupt had not yet occurred).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The structure of the task used in Example 7.1 is adequate only if
interrupts occur at a relatively low frequency. To understand why,
consider what would happen if a second, and then a third, interrupt had
occurred before the task had completed its processing of the first
interrupt:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When the second ISR executed, the semaphore would be empty, so the
ISR would give the semaphore, and the task would process the second
event immediately after it had completed processing the first event.
That scenario is shown in Figure 7.6.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the third ISR executed, the semaphore would already be
available, preventing the ISR giving the semaphore again, so the
task would not know the third event had occurred. That scenario is
shown in Figure 7.7.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="fig7.6" title="Figure 7.6 The scenario when one interrupt occurs before the task has finished processing the first event"></a>

</div>
<p>The deferred interrupt handling task used in Example 7.1, and shown in
Listing 7.7, is structured so that it only processes one event between
each call to <code>xSemaphoreTake()</code>. That was adequate for Example 7.1, because
the interrupts that generated the events were triggered by software, and
occurred at a predictable time. In real applications, interrupts are
generated by hardware, and occur at unpredictable times. Therefore, to
minimize the chance of an interrupt being missed, the deferred interrupt
handling task must be structured so that it processes all the events
that are already available between each call to <code>xSemaphoreTake()</code><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-17-1"><a href="#footnote-17">4</a></sup>.
This is demonstrated by Listing 7.10, which shows how a deferred interrupt
handler for a UART could be structured. In Listing 7.10, it is assumed the
UART generates a receive interrupt each time a character is received,
and that the UART places received characters into a hardware FIFO (a
hardware buffer).</p>
<p>The deferred interrupt handling task used in Example 7.1 had one other
weakness; it did not use a timeout when it called <code>xSemaphoreTake()</code>.
Instead, the task passed <code>portMAX_DELAY</code> as the <code>xSemaphoreTake()</code>
<code>xTicksToWait</code> parameter, which results in the task waiting indefinitely
(without a timeout) for the semaphore to be available. Indefinite
timeouts are often used in example code because their use simplifies the
structure of the example, and therefore makes the example easier to
understand. However, indefinite timeouts are normally bad practice in
real applications, because they make it difficult to recover from an
error. As an example, consider the scenario where a task is waiting for
an interrupt to give a semaphore, but an error state in the hardware is
preventing the interrupt from being generated:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the task is waiting without a timeout, it will not know about
the error state, and will wait forever.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the task is waiting with a timeout, then <code>xSemaphoreTake()</code> will
return <code>pdFAIL</code> when the timeout expires, and the task can then
detect and clear the error the next time it executes. This scenario
is also demonstrated in Listing 7.10.</p>
